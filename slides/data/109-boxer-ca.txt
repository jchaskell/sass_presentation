What an important bill we have done, all of us together, across party lines. I am very hopeful we can see this bill move forward so the American people can move forward with their lives. They need the highways. They need the transit. They need the jobs this bill promises. 
   I wished to thank him before he left the floor.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge a special milestone for one of America's beloved entertainers and philanthropists. I am pleased to extend my sincere congratulations to Hugh O'Brian as he celebrates his 80th birthday. 
   Hugh O'Brian came into the public eye in the role of Wyatt Earp in the 1950s television series, ``The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp.'' An accomplished stage and screen actor, he used his talents to bring history to life while expanding his influential role well beyond the theater and television to the broader stage. 
   In 1958, Mr. O'Brian established the organization HOBY, Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership, aiming to provide support for young people striving for excellence. Over the past 47 years, HOBY has promoted extensive volunteerism, active global citizenship, and bright futures for young people. Through HOBY, Mr. O'Brian encourages local, national, and international communities to be responsive to the needs of our future leaders, empowering countless young people with knowledge and conscientious role models. 
   We are extremely fortunate that people like Hugh O'Brian are committed to bringing people together in the spirit of creative problem-solving and positive social change. In his many roles, Mr. O'Brian has led, inspired, and provided hope. On the occasion of his 80th birthday, please join me in congratulating Mr. Hugh O'Brian on his lifetime of accomplishment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor the memory of the late Nels Daniel Niemi, an officer with the city of San Leandro Police Department. Officer Niemi was a 3-year veteran of the San Leandro Police Department who dedicated his life to his family, community, and Nation. He was tragically killed in the line of duty on July 25, 2005. 
   Officer Niemi was born 42 years ago in Guam. A graduate of De La Salle High School in Concord, CA, Officer Niemi first worked as a network administrator in the computer industry. Officer Niemi also taught self-defense and gun-awareness classes, which raised his longtime interest in law enforcement. Four years ago, he decided to switch careers, and enrolled in the Police Academy. An officer with the San Leandro Police Department for the last 3 years, he excelled at his job. He was a dedicated and caring officer, who often used his computer expertise in investigations. Through his hard work  and dedication to public safety, Officer Niemi earned the respect and admiration of those with whom he worked. 
   Officer Niemi will long be remembered for his courage, service, and bravery. He will be missed by all who knew him. Officer Niemi is survived by his parents Rudie and Mildred Niemi; brother Jim; wife Dionne; daughter Gabrielle; and stepson Josh Hewitt. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the accomplishments of some incredibly focused and dedicated young athletes from southern California. This year, the members of Team Inland placed third in the Nike National Youth Basketball Tournament, became the Amateur Athletic Union, AAU, West Coast National Champions, and won the AAU Southern Pacific Division 1 Regional Tournament. 
   Team Inland is a nonprofit organization based in the city of San Bernardino. It is comprised of 11-year-olds, who commit their time to prepare for numerous weekend basketball tournaments throughout the year. In 2005, they won 77 percent of their games, earning impressive placements in many tournaments. 
   Making Team Inland's achievement even more meaningful is the fact that team members excelled academically while striving to meet their athletic goals, each maintaining a minimum 3.0 grade point average. It is clear that these young people have set high standards for themselves and put forth tremendous effort to meet them. 
   The members of 2005 Team Inland are: Marquise Drumwright, Ejiro Ederaine, Tyler Ervin, Quinton Lilley, Jordan Mathis, Myles Pearson, Isaiah Pooler, Kameron Presley, Chandler Scott, Justin Snavely, Dominique Walker, and Arther Ley Williams. 
   The Team Inland players have demonstrated their immense potential to achieve. I hope you are heartened, as I am, to learn of young people striving for personal excellence. I extend my sincere congratulations to Team Inland  and thank them for their great team spirit.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to salute a wonderful and historic event that is about to take place in my home State. On Friday, July 1, 2005, Antonio Villaraigosa will be sworn in as mayor of the great city of Los Angeles, CA. 
   With nearly 4 million residents, Los Angeles is a huge and dynamic city, and running it well will be a huge challenge. But Antonio Villaraigosa is ready, willing, and able to do the job. 
   I believe that Mayor Villaraigosa has the intelligence, talent, energy, courage, compassion, imagination, and experience needed to unite Los Angeles and move it forward to new greatness. 
   Antonio has shown this ability throughout his career as a labor leader, civic leader, and elected official. He has worked with Democrats and Republicans from all backgrounds and all parts of California to improve education, protect the rights of working families, expand health care coverage, and make our communities safer, better places to live. 
   Time and again, he has demonstrated the leadership skills that will help him make Los Angeles one of the world's great cities of the 21st century. 
   Antonio Villaraigosa has already made history by becoming the first Latino mayor of Los Angeles since 1872, but he has set his sights even higher. He hopes to make history by making Los Angeles work for all its residents, and I will do all I can to help him.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the important work and accomplishments of the California Teamsters Hispanic Caucus. I am also pleased to commend International Brotherhood of Teamsters, IBT, General President James P. Hoffa, and General Secretary-Treasurer C. Thomas Keegel for their continued support of the California Teamsters Hispanic Caucus's efforts in awarding educational scholarships and conducting community improvement and community education programs. 
   The California Teamsters Hispanic Caucus, formed in 1989 as a nonprofit organization, has experienced phenomenal growth and success. Since the Hispanic Caucus' early beginnings, membership has grown to include more than 250 active members. The support that the caucus has provided to its members has also grown throughout the years. In nearly two decades of service, the Hispanic Caucus has increased the number of its educational scholarships from 3 to nearly 20 and has distributed more than $200,000. 
   Both General President Hoffa and General Secretary-Treasurer Keegel have shown tremendous support for the California Teamsters Hispanic Caucus through their involvement in increasing the availability of educational scholarship funding and participation in annual Hispanic Caucus events. Their work, in combination with the fine work of the Hispanic Caucus, has allowed the children of Teamsters to continue their education and pursue their dreams. 
   I invite all of my colleagues to join me in commending the California Teamsters Hispanic Caucus, International Brotherhood of Teamsters General President James P. Hoffa and General Secretary-Treasurer C. Thomas Keegel for their continued support for education, for strong communities, and for all working people.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I speak to honor the memory of the late John Greeno, Bald Mountain heliport manager with the Mi-Wok Ranger District of Stanislaus National Forest. Mr. Greeno was a 21-year veteran of the U.S. Forest Service who dedicated his life to his family, community, and Nation. He was killed in a tragic helicopter crash in Texas on March 10, 2005, while on volunteer assignment to conduct a prescribed burn in Sabine National Forest. 
   John Greeno was born on June 2, 1952 in Redwood City, CA, and was raised in the town of Independence, CA. He embarked upon his career with the U.S. Forest Service in 1979 as a temporary employee on the Inyo National Forest. His love for firefighting and the U.S. Forest Service led him to the Stanislaus National Forest where he would eventually rise to the position of Helitack superintendent. During his 21 years of service, John earned the respect and admiration of those with whom he worked for consistently going above and beyond the call of duty. He led by example and was considered a mentor by subordinates. John regularly volunteered for assignments like the one that claimed his life in Sabine  National Forest in order to sharpen his skills and bring back valuable knowledge for his home-base. 
   John Greeno will long be remembered for his courage and dedication. He is survived by his wife of 11 years and his two children Marcus and Montana. His service and bravery inspired others and he will be deeply missed. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the memory of a dedicated public servant, Sheriff Deputy Maria Cecilia Rosa. Deputy Rosa spent nearly 6 years with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, providing the citizens of California with safety and service. On the morning of March 28, 2006, Deputy Rosa was shot while in the city of Long Beach as she prepared to leave for work at the Inmate Reception Center in downtown Los Angeles. She subsequently died from her injuries. 
   Deputy Maria Rosa was well respected by her peers and received numerous outstanding evaluations by her supervisors who described her as ``a self starter'' and an ``outstanding Training Officer.'' Her attitude and performance were always top rate, and she was always fair and courteous to everyone with whom she came in contact. Many describe her ``wonderful sense of humor with an electric smile.'' Colleagues note that she was affable, yet tough, and approached even the most mundane tasks with energy and enthusiasm. 
   Deputy Rosa is survived by her sister Luz Maria Yanez and brothers Eduardo and Maricelo Yanez. When she was not on duty, Deputy Rosa loved to dance, especially Salsa. She was extremely caring and always available to a friend. Deputy Maria Rosa served the State of California with honor and distinction and honorably fulfilled her oath as an officer of the law. Her contributions and dedication to law enforcement are greatly appreciated and will serve as a shining example of her legacy. 
   Californians are grateful for Deputy Rosa's heroic service and the sacrifices she made while serving the community and protecting the people she loved.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Center for Provisional Accelerated Learning, PAL, in San Bernardino, CA. For the past 20 years, the Provisional Accelerated Learning Center has been an outstanding community center for service and support. 
   The PAL Center was the vision of Dr. Mildred Dalton Henry, a retired professor emeritus from California State University at San Bernardino. In August 1983, Dr. Henry, community resident Alonza Thompson, and other members of the community worked together to establish a community-based learning center. 
   Today, these PAL Center founders can look back at 20 successful years of community outreach and mentorship that has changed the lives of many. Many students have written about the gratitude and fond memories they hold for the PAL Center and the positive effect it had on their lives. 
   At the PAL Center, individuals from throughout the community can receive quality educational services and individual life assistance and support. The PAL Center values cultural diversity and strives to assist individuals from all walks of life. In many communities throughout our Nation, troubling situations have forced many individuals to go without the assistance that could change their lives. In San Bernardino, these same individuals can count on the PAL Center to help them plan for and take action to face life's challenges and plan for successful futures. 
   I applaud the service and dedication of the community heroes at the Center for Provisional Accelerated Learning in San Bernardino. Their efforts have made a lasting impression on their community, and set a standard for our nation. Please join me in honoring them on their 20th anniversary.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an exceptional group of students with disabilities in southern California from Hesperia Junior High School. Kattie Greene, Emilee Landon, David Perez, and Eric Coldwell have achieved outstanding success in science and problem solving. 
   These students formed the Hands-Off Telephone Band Team. Together, they developed an apparatus that allows a cellular telephone to be mounted to a wrist or arm--creating an effective and simple assistive technology device that enables some individuals with disabilities to independently use a cellular phone. 
   The Hands-Off Telephone Band Team's ingenious creation was chosen as one of eight projects from nationwide to be judged by the renowned Christopher Columbus Foundation, which, along with the National Science Foundation, strive to improve America's middle school students' literacy in mathematics and science. Despite facing formidable competition, the Hands-Off Telephone Band Team's project was deservedly selected as the Gold Medal Award Winning Team. Kattie, Emilee, David, and Eric's commitment to excellence, coupled with their mastery of the scientific process, enabled them to return to Hesperia Junior High School as heroes of the community. 
   I commend these students not only for their success in this prestigious competition but also because they are the first team comprised of students with disabilities to win this national competition. Each of these incredible young people utilized their abilities and coordinated their efforts to succeed. Eighth grade instructor Barbara Jacobs deserves commendation on her successful mentorship of these young students. 
   I applaud the dedication of the Hands-Off Telephone Band Team from Hesperia Junior High School. Their success has provided an example of determination to us all.

On the morning of February 17, 2006, while on motor patrol near the City of Salida, Officer Scott was mercilessly murdered in the line of duty during a traffic stop. 
   The California Highway Patrol was in Officer Scott's bloodlines. Officer Scott's father, Sergeant William Scott, as well as two uncles, are proud retired California Highway Patrol veterans. Officer Scott was to celebrate his 5-year anniversary with the California Highway Patrol on February 19. Officer Scott dutifully served the citizens and communities of Stanislaus and San Joaquin counties with great dedication and integrity. Officer Scott's commitment to help others, combined with his passion for law enforcement, enabled him to become a model California Highway Patrol officer. Officer Scott's colleagues shall always remember his gregarious nature and commitment to his job. 
   Officer Scott is survived by his father, William Scott, and his mother, Judith. When he was not on duty, Officer Scott enjoyed spending time with his neighbors, especially the children who would often play darts and watch sporting events in his garage. Officer Earl Harwood Scott served the State of California with honor and distinction and fulfilled his oath as an officer of the law. His contributions and dedication to law enforcement are greatly appreciated and will serve as a shining example of his legacy.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to salute Mark Salo, who is retiring this fall after more than 31 years as the head of Planned Parenthood of San Diego and Riverside Counties, PPSDRC. A pioneer and visionary in the field of reproductive health care, he is a great champion of women's health and freedom of choice. 
   When Mark Salo began working with San Diego Planned Parenthood in 1974, it comprised one small clinic whose 12 employees provided 5,000 patient visits a year. Today PPSDRC is the second-largest Planned Parenthood affiliate in the Nation, with an annual budget of $35 million and 400 employees who provide more than 200,000 patient visits. 
   The San Diego/Riverside affiliate has been a pioneer in the expansion of medical services to include vasectomies, tubal ligations, prenatal care, and mifepristone. PPSDRC oversees an Emmy-award-winning teen theatre and a variety of innovative teen outreach programs. It offers local midlife services, male and female sterilization services, and a thriving prenatal practice. 
   Mark has reached across the border from San Diego to build a Planned Parenthood of truly international scope by developing and funding a binational program in northern Baja California, Mexico. PPSDRC's ``Mexico Fund'' supports five medical facilities in the poor colonias around Tijuana and funds contraceptive programs in the foreign-owned manufacturing plants known as maquiladoras. 
   Over the years, Mark has also become the most visible public advocate of reproductive rights in the San Diego region. He represents Planned Parenthood through television news, interview shows, debate forums, newspaper commentaries, and live radio appearances. 
   I know that everyone who values women's health and reproductive freedom will join me in saluting Mark Salo and sending him best wishes for a well-earned, active retirement.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the 75th anniversary of the Jewish Federation of Silicon Valley. 
   In 1930, the Jewish Federation of Silicon Valley, JFSV, was incorporated into the national Jewish Federation system to promote philanthropic and humanitarian activities in Santa Clara County. For 75 years, JFSV has served as a focal point for the Jewish community in Silicon Valley. With a membership of over 13,000, the JFSV is committed to preservation and enrichment of Jewish culture, and to expressing Jewish community concerns about Jewish life in Santa Clara County, the United States, Israel and throughout the world. 
   Over the past 75 years, JFSV has expanded greatly, and now offers a wide variety of programs to its members. The Silicon Valley Young Adults Division offers educational and social programs to members ages 25-40. The Women's Philanthropy Division focuses on community-building, educational, social, and cultural enrichment for women, while offering great networking opportunities to women members. Blue Knot, the Jewish Technology Initiative, creates opportunities for Jewish professionals in the technology sector to exchange ideas and expand networks. 
   JFSV is based on the caring philosophies of Klal Yisrael, the responsibility of each Jew for another, and Tikun Olam, repairing the world through social action. JFSV has mentored many members who have dedicated themselves to community service in Silicon Valley and the Greater Bay Area. Through its outreach, JFSV has successfully enhanced social and civic participation in the Silicon Valley community. 
   The Jewish Federation of Silicon Valley's service to the Jewish community, both in Santa Clara County and nationwide, is truly inspiring. I congratulate the Jewish Federation of Silicon Valley on their 75th anniversary and wish them another 75 years of success.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Rancho Buena Vista Little League Team of San Diego, CA, that represented the Western Region in the Little League World Series. 
   The Rancho Buena Vista Team treated fans to a thrilling season, including an amazing 24-game winning streak. Their season culminated in a 5 to 4 victory over the team from Chiba City, Japan to win third place at the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA. On August 14, 2005, Rancho Buena Vista defeated Tracy, California 7 to 2 in the West regional championship game, finishing with a 6 to 0 record. The Vista Little Leaguers became the sixth U.S. region representative and 14 overall to qualify for the 2005 Little League World Series. 
   The team displayed commitment to teamwork, gamesmanship, and a love of baseball as a team sport as they each played fair, strived to win, and always did their best. Vista's pitcher Kalen Pimentel struck out 18 batters in 1 regulation game to tie a Little League record. 
   On September 10, 2005, in the City of Vista, the Rancho Buena Vista Team will celebrate their victory with fellow San Diegans. The team will be joined by their friends, family, supporters, and coaches Randy Reznicek, Joseph Pimentel, and manager Marty Miller in a parade. They come together to celebrate the team's strength of character, level headedness, pride, and commitment which lead them to victory. 
   It is with great pleasure that I commend the athletes of the Rancho Buena Vista Little League Team for the determination, composure, and sportsmanship they exhibited throughout the 2005 Little League World Series and for their many accomplishments on the field throughout the tournament. I wish them great success in the future.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened to inform you of the passing of Judge William Matthew Byrne, Jr. I would like to take a few moments to recognize Judge Byrne's many important accomplishments and the tremendous impact he made on the judicial system. 
   William Byrne was born in East Los Angeles in 1930 and attended Loyola High School and the University of Southern California. Before becoming a Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, he served as a judge advocate from 1956 to 1958 in the U.S. Air Force. In 1967, he was appointed as U.S. attorney by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1970, when President Richard Nixon created the President's Commission on Campus Unrest, he chose William Byrne as its executive director. 
   Byrne became the youngest judge ever appointed to the Federal bench when he was confirmed in 1971 at age 40, and he served as the Central District's chief judge from 1994 to 1998. In more than 30 years of service on the Federal bench, Judge Byrne had the opportunity to handle many cases. He is, however, best known for presiding over the Pentagon Papers case, which was assigned to him just 2 years after his confirmation as a Federal judge. The Pentagon Papers case involved military analyst Daniel Ellsberg and co-defendant Anthony J. Russo, Jr. who were indicted on 12 Federal counts, including conspiracy, theft of Government property, and espionage after an unauthorized release of a secret study of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Judge Byrne dismissed the case in 1973 after ruling that it was the Government that was guilty of misconduct. 
   I invite all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring Judge William Matthew Byrne, Jr., for his long and distinguished service to our country.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the Miracle League, an organization dedicated to providing opportunities for all children to play baseball, regardless of their abilities. 
   In 1997, Coach Eddie Bagwell of the Rockdale Youth Baseball Association in Atlanta, GA, noticed a young boy in a wheelchair on the sidelines at all of the youth baseball team's practices and games. The enthusiasm and excitement that this boy had for baseball was inspiring and it was then that Coach Eddie realized that youth with disabilities ought to have the same opportunities as others to play ball. 
   In 1988, Coach Bagwell formed the Miracle League, a youth baseball league designed to allow children of all abilities to participate in our Nation's favorite pastime--baseball. The league started with 35 children. The following year, the number more than doubled, with 80 children clamoring to join a team. Since the Miracle League was breaking new ground, it came up with five rules to play by: every player bats once each inning; all base runners are safe; every player scores a run before the inning is over (last one up gets a home run); community volunteers serve as ``buddies'' to assist the players; and each team and each player wins every game. 
   As word spread quickly, Miracle League baseball teams were started across the country. In my home State of California, there are now four Miracle League teams: in Belmont, Westminster, Ventura County, and Visalia. Nationwide, there are more than 50 Miracle League teams. 
   I commend the Miracle League for its philosophy that ``Every Child Deserves  a Chance to Play Baseball.'' As the Miracle League begins its Spring 2005 season, I send my best wishes for a fun and exiting season. Play Ball!

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we begin a new year and a new Congress, more than 1.2 million Rotarians in 166 countries are beginning the centennial celebration of Rotary International. 
   On February 23, 1905, the Rotary Club of Chicago was formed by Paul P. Harris, an attorney who wanted to recapture the friendly spirit of small-town America in a big-city professional club. The new group took its name from the practice of rotating club meetings among members' offices. 
   Rotary quickly grew, with clubs forming across the country and around the world. At the same time, the organization's interests expanded from social and professional interests to community service. 
   Along with public service, Rotary has given the world a high standard of ethics known as the 4-Way Test. This test asks the following four questions of the things we think, say, or do: 
   1. Is it the truth? 
   2. Is it fair to all concerned? 
   3. Will it build goodwill and better friendships? 
   4. Will it be beneficial to all concerned? 
   During and after World War II, Rotary International became deeply involved in efforts to promote global peace and understanding. Rotary members actively supported the founding of the United Nations and helped to establish UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. 
   In recent years, Rotary International has helped communities around the world to address some of the critical needs of our day, including disease, hunger, illiteracy, environmental degradation, and children at risk. Rotary has been the lead organization in PolioPlus, a global effort to immunize all the world's children against polio. 
   On the occasion of the Rotary Centennial, I send my sincere appreciation and best wishes to Rotary International and Rotarians everywhere.

   Founded 5 years ago with the generous support of Charles R. Williams, the Williams Institute produces substantive scholarship on matters pertaining to sexual orientation law and public policy. The first and only institution of its kind in the United States, the institute produces scholarship on sexual orientation issues through the collaborative efforts of scholars, judges, advocates, and students. Those working for the Williams Institute have published an array of documents ranging from amicus briefs that have proved useful in key court cases to books that have helped legal scholars comprehend the ramifications of a constantly evolving body of law. 
   Educating members of the legal community in America through continuing legal education, lectures, symposia, classes, and speakers is a critical part  of the Williams Institute's mission. This focus on disseminating information, coupled with the intellectual and material resources of UCLA, has made the Williams Institute into a national center for the interdisciplinary exploration of sexual orientation law and policy matters by scholars, judges, practitioners, advocates, and students. 
   The Williams Institute actively strives to produce well-informed young lawyers. To this end, student involvement in the organization is of paramount importance. Students partake in research with faculty scholars and contribute to the wide breadth of scholarship produced by the Williams Institute. 
   I invite my colleagues to join me in commending the work of the Williams Institute. In a nation where equal treatment under the law is a central tenet of citizenship, the Williams Institute plays a critical role in ensuring that America lives by its creed.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the Chinese Lunar New Year. 2006 is the Year of the Dog. 
   The Chinese calendar is based on the cycles of the sun and the moon, and the Chinese Lunar New Year is the most important of Chinese festivals. Celebration begins on the first day of the first moon of the lunar calendar and ends on the full moon 15 days later, with the Lantern Festival. In order to prepare for the new year, families perform several rituals to cleanse the home and the spirit, to sweep away misfortune and to welcome in the new year with good luck, health, happiness and prosperity. 
   The Chinese lunar calendar is associated with a 12-year animal zodiac. According to ancient Chinese legend, Buddha asked all the animals to meet him on the Chinese Lunar New Year. Twelve animals came, and Buddha rewarded each animal by naming a year after each one. The 12 animals--Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig--represent a cyclical concept of time. He told each animal that the people born in their year would inherit some of the personality traits of that animal. It is said that those born in the Year of the Dog tend to be loyal, kind, and generous. 
   America is rich with the cultural traditions of many countries. In California, the Chinese-American community plays a vibrant and important part of our State's history. Celebrating the Chinese Lunar New Year allows us to embrace this significant and most important cultural festival of the Chinese calendar. 
   I hope that the Chinese Lunar New Year brings good health, happiness, peace and prosperity to all. I give my very best wishes for an auspicious New Year.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Hurricane Katrina has caused unprecedented destruction and suffering for so many people in this country. The rest of the Nation has been extremely generous to help people who are suffering from the devastation caused by Katrina. 
   One area where people need help is rebuilding housing. To help Katrina victims, Habitat for Humanity International is launching ``Operation Home Delivery,'' to provide assistance and rebuilding opportunities in New Orleans and elsewhere along the gulf coast. A major component of this operation is the ``home in a box project.'' 
   The plan is to ``pre-build'' the frame of a home. The house will be assembled to ensure the construction, and, then, the frame will be taken apart and the components placed, along with other necessary construction materials, in a container and shipped to an area along the gulf coast or New Orleans where families, volunteers, and builders will rebuild the home. 
   ``Operation Home Delivery'' homes will mirror traditional Habitat homes by being simple and affordable, providing approximately 1,100 to 1,300 square feet of living space. The estimated cost of a house for the gulf region is only $85,000. This includes all components to completely build the home and costs associated with transportation, delivery, utilities and site preparation. The first project in ``Operation Home Delivery'' will be this month in Jackson, MS. 
   I am asking each Senator to go back to your respective States and seek assistance for Habitat for this outstanding project. Designated dollars for ``Operation Home Delivery'' will purchase specific pieces of the house. For example, $35 will buy roof shingles or $100 will buy a front door. These gifts will allow people not only to have a home but to begin to rebuild their lives. 
   Habitat for Humanity is working to provide hope for the future to the victims of Katrina with this worthy project.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last week I had the pleasure of joining members of the California Missions Foundation at Mission San Diego to celebrate the passage of the California Missions Preservation Act, which became law in 2004. 
   In opening the celebration, Missions Foundation Executive Director Knox Mellon expressed his gratitude to the Senate and House for passing the Missions Preservation Act, which will help my State preserve a priceless element of our historical and cultural heritage. 
   By way of expressing my own gratitude to you and our colleagues, I want to share some of Mr. Mellon's remarks with you:  
   There is a tendency for me to believe the primary beneficiary of the legislation Senator Boxer both carried and succeeded in getting signed by the President would be the California Missions Foundation because it acts as a conduit, a pass-through for directing monies to each of the twenty-one historic missions. But the real beneficiaries are the people not only of California but the nation. The missions are California's Pyramids. They are a part of our past. They help symbolize the nation's western beginnings. 
   Of all the institutions that define California's heritage, none has the historic significance and emotional impact of the chain of Spanish missions that stretch from San Diego to Sonoma. The missions are an important part of the state's cultural fabric and must be preserved as priceless historic monuments.  
   I thank our colleagues in Congress, particularly Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN and Representatives SAM FARR and DAVID DREIER, who worked diligently to see this bill signed into law. I also thank Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger for his support. 
   And finally, I thank Knox Mellon and the California Missions Foundation Board for their strong dedication to this cause. Through the collaboration of Federal, State, and private efforts, our missions have hope for the future.

Perry is retiring after 5 years as IBEW Local 1245 business manager and more than 40 years of outstanding service to the labor community in California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. 
   Perry Zimmerman began his career at Pacific Gas and Electric Company in 1962. During his 19 years there, he was an active union member, serving as a shop steward, unit chairman, and advisory council member. 
   In 1981, Perry joined the staff of IBEW Local 1245 as business representative, where he served members in Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area. After 11 years, he was promoted to assistant business manager and served area members in both the private and public sectors.

As business manager, Perry was committed to being in regular touch with members, informing them of leadership decisions and requesting their opinions. He has said this was his favorite part of his job. 
   After more than 40 years of service to working families, Perry Zimmerman deserves some time off. Along with his friends and admirers throughout the Western United States, I wish him a long and pleasurable retirement.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on the occasion of its 100th anniversary, I am proud to recognize and honor the American Thoracic Society for its continuing commitment to the prevention and treatment of respiratory disease. 
   While respiratory disease may not pose the same public threat that it did 100 years ago, we cannot forget, nor overlook, the need to continue our fight against such debilitating illnesses. It is imperative that we continue to explore the causes and effects of respiratory disease as well as educating the public here and abroad. 
   Since its establishment in 1905, the American Thoracic Society has demonstrated an unyielding determination to reduce the number of deaths from respiratory disorder and acute-illness. I commend ATS for its dedication to the cause. 
   ATS not only directs its attention to the care and treatment of respiratory disease patients, it also places preventative practices at the forefront of its mission. Through extensive scientific research, ATS has established itself as a leader in the discovery of new information and knowledge. Furthermore, ATS has developed numerous educational programs, as well as several medical journals, to help keep both the medical community and the public up to date on new scientific information and innovative practices. 
   Finally, ATS has established itself as a leading advocate of respiratory research, paving the way for unprecedented developments in the treatment of respiratory disease. As host of the world's leading respiratory medicine conference, which provides doctors and scientists the opportunity to share their successes with specialists from all over the world, ATS has truly confirmed its status as a leader in the medical community. 
   Over the years, ATS has grown to meet the needs of the changing world in which we live, while never losing sight of its basic goals of prevention and treatment. I congratulate the American Thoracic Society on its 100 years of outstanding research and innovation.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate Dr. Philip Gold on receiving the Rabbi Norman F. Feldheym Award. The Rabbi Norman F. Feldheym Award was established to pay tribute to those members of Congregation Emanu El who have conspicuously and exceptionally reflected Rabbi Feldheym's qualities of love for and loyalty to the synagogue, service to the community, and the personal traits of humility, loving kindness, care, and love. Dr. Gold receives this award as part of the ceremonies marking the 115th anniversary of the founding of the congregation. 
   Dr. Philip M. Gold has been an extraordinarily devoted leader of Congregation Emanu El through his service as a member of its board of directors since 1990. He served as secretary, second vice-president, vice-president, and, from 2000 until 2002, he served as the president of the congregation. 
   During his remarkable tenure with Congregation Emanu El, Dr. Gold has masterfully guided it through a period of leadership change. He has been an inspirational leader of the congregation with a deep love for Judaism, participation in worship and education, and an exemplary commitment to Jewish values and their application to contemporary society. 
   In addition to his immense contributions to Congregation Emanu El, Dr. Gold is a highly respected physician and teacher, and he has been recognized by his colleagues as a leader in the field of medicine. He has served as the president of various medical organizations, and he has received numerous awards for his work and achievements.

Gold is a truly deserving recipient of an award that honors the importance of integrity, character, ethics, humility, and love for others. Throughout his life, Dr. Gold has consistently embodied the best ideals of human values.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Today I rise to honor and share with my colleagues the memory of a remarkable man, Officer David Marin Romero of the California Highway Patrol. Officer David Marin Romero spent 23 years with the California Highway Patrol, providing the citizens of California with safety and service. On September 23, 2005, while on motor patrol in the city of Industry, Officer Romero was struck and killed by a driver suspected to be under the influence of a controlled substance.  
   The California Highway Patrol was Officer Romero's passion. He began his career with the California Highway Patrol at the Riverside Station near his home, and a year later he transferred to the Sante Fe Springs Station, near his childhood community. Romero served the remainder of his career in Santa Fe Springs, giving back to his community. He loved riding his motorcycle and combined this with his passion for law enforcement to become a very successful motorcycle officer. Officer Romero's colleagues shall always remember his infectious grin, practical jokes, and commitment to his job. 
   Officer Romero was a devoted family man. He is survived by his wife Sandra and children, Austin, Windsor, David, Victor, and Vanessa. When he was not on duty, Officer Romero enjoyed spending time with his family, riding dirt bikes, and coaching his children's sports teams. Officer David Marin Romero served the State of California honorably and conscientiously, and fulfilled his oath as an officer of the law. Officer Romero gave his life while assisting those in peril or distress. His character, integrity, loyalty, and dedication to law enforcement are greatly appreciated and will never be forgotten. 
   Officer David Marin Romero sacrificed his life doing what he loved to do--providing protection for the community in which he was raised. We shall always be grateful for Officer Romero's heroic service and the sacrifices he made while protecting the community he loved.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few moments to recognize the many important accomplishments of John W. Mack, as the Los Angeles Unified School District opens a new elementary school on South Catalina Street in Los Angeles bearing his name. 
   Earlier this year, John W. Mack stepped down from his post as president of the Los Angeles Urban League after 36 years of service. During his tenure, John led the venerable civil rights organization through an amazing period of growth and accomplishment. His ability to build coalitions with a wide variety of groups enabled him to keep the Los Angeles Urban League focused on providing opportunity to African Americans and other minorities over the years. Under John's leadership, the Los Angeles Urban League's budget grew from $1.7 million to nearly $25 million; providing funding for innovative, results-oriented  job training, job placement, education, academic tutorial, youth achievement and business development programs, serving more than 112,000 people annually. Countless individuals credit John and the Los Angeles Urban League for helping them turn their lives around for the better, start businesses, and complete their education. 
   John Mack has an innate ability to forge partnerships with elected officials, corporate leaders, local clergy, and community residents. His ability to build bridges has made him a highly respected advocate for equal opportunities in education, law enforcement and economic empowerment and has garnered him many awards. His coalition-building skills also proved useful during his youth, as he was an early leader of the civil rights movement with Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
   I invite my colleagues to join me and the thousands of people touched by his work in commending John W. Mack for his great leadership and tireless advocacy throughout his lifetime. Naming an elementary school after a man who devoted so much of his life to bettering our Nation will remind all who walk through its halls about the importance of community service.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the accomplishments of the incredibly hard-working and dedicated members of the 2006 U.S. Winter Olympics team. This year, our team won 25 individual and team medals, including 9 gold medals. 
   Olympic athletes commit years of time and effort to earning the honor of representing the United States at the Olympic Games. Upon reaching the games, their determination stayed constant, even when faced with injury and adversity. Their spirit and willingness to strive for excellence no matter what the situation serves as an example for all Americans. 
   I would especially like to recognize the 27 Californians who competed in Turin. While California is widely known for our wonderful weather and beautiful beaches, we also boast some of our Nation's finest winter athletes. The following seven California athletes won medals as well:  
   Chanda Gunn of Huntington Beach won bronze as a member of the U.S. Women's Hockey team. 
   Rusty Smith from Long Beach won a bronze medal as a member of the Short Track Speedskating 5,000-meter relay team. 
   Sasha Cohen of Corona del Mar won the silver medal in Figure Skating. 
   Valerie Fleming from Foster City won silver as a part of the two-member Bobsled Team. 
   Danny Kass of Mammoth Lakes won the silver medal in the Snowboarding Half-Pipe event. 
   Julia Mancuso from Olympic Valley won gold in the Alpine Skiing Giant Slalom. 
   Finally, Shaun White of Carlsbad brought home the gold medal in the Snowboarding Half-pipe event.  
   The spirit of adventure and determination displayed by these athletes is a wonderful example of our country's potential to achieve. I hope you are heartened, as I am, to learn of Americans striving for personal excellence. I extend my sincere congratulations to California Olympians and all of our country's athletes, and I thank them for their great team spirit.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few moments to recognize the amazing life accomplishments of Arthur Winston as he is honored by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority--MTA--family during his retirement and 100th birthday celebration. 
   Arthur Winston began his association with the MTA at the young age of 15. He would assist his father who was employed by the maintenance department for one of MTA's predecessors, the Pacific Electric Railway Company. In 1924, Arthur began his career with the Pacific Electric Railway Company. After a brief period of separation between 1928 through 1934, he returned at the age of 28 and began 72 years of continuous work. In total, Arthur has devoted 76 years of his life to public service and has missed only day of work since 1934, which occurred when his wife passed away in 1988. 
   In 1996, Arthur Winston received a congressional citation from President Bill Clinton as ``Employee of the Century.'' In 1997, the MTA board of directors named the agency's bus operating division in South Central Los Angeles, Chesterfield Square, after him. He has also appeared on the Oprah Winfry television show where he was invited to share his life's story with her television viewing audience. 
   Arthur Winston was born in Oklahoma on March 22, 1906 before Oklahoma was officially recognized as a State. He and his family moved to Los Angeles in 1918, when Arthur was 12. He attended Jefferson High School and graduated in 1922. Currently assigned to the bus operations division that bears his name, Arthur serves as an attendant leader and directs a crew of 11 employees. Through their efforts, Los Angeles city buses are properly maintained for use by the city's residents. 
   I invite all of my colleagues to join me and the members of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority family in commending Arthur Winston for his 100th Birthday and his 76 years of service and dedication to MTA and the city of Los Angeles.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few moments to recognize the many important accomplishments of Fernando Valenzuela, former pitcher, current radio broadcast announcer and long time member of the Los Angeles Dodgers family. 
   Fernando Valenzuela has been an amazing asset to the Los Angeles community. He has enriched the lives of many young children through their participation in the Amigos de Fernando children's program--an innercity youth program he founded that is designed to reward underprivileged children for their positive and active involvement in community sports teams. 
   For the third consecutive Major League Baseball season, the Amigos de Fernando children's program, with support from the Los Angeles Dodgers, has continued to assist local children's groups. Through their efforts, inner-city children's groups receive assistance in continuing to guide and positively influence the children they service. The Amigos de Fernando children's program has provided nearly 1,000 young people of the City of Los Angeles with new and positive experiences that would have otherwise been unavailable to them. 
   Fernando Valenzuela began his career with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1979. Since his rookie year in Major League Baseball, he has reached many notable accomplishments including honors as Rookie of the Year in 1981 and the highly coveted Cy Young Award--presented to each league's most outstanding pitcher--also in 1981. In addition to his many personal accomplishments, Fernando also played a significant role in achieving many team distinctions and championships, including the National League Pennant and World Series Championships for the 1981 and 1988 seasons. After a brief absence from the Los Angeles area, Fernando rejoined the Los Angeles Dodgers organization in 2003 as a member of the Spanish-Language radio commentator team, providing his expertise and views to countless fans. 
   I invite all of my colleagues to join me and the children of the City of Los Angeles in commending Fernando Valenzuela for his great leadership and service to the community through the Amigos de Fernando. His efforts are truly worthy of this recognition.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Laura Esguerra Adams, a member of my staff who died last week after a valiant struggle against cancer. I want the Senate and the American people to know about this extraordinary young woman who served us all so well. 
   Laura was my Web designer, in charge of my Senate Web site. Over the past several years, she transformed ``boxer.senate.gov'' from a simple, nondescript Web page to a modern, cutting-edge site that has won awards for its clean look, comprehensive content, and accessibility. 
   Today thousands of Californians visit this site every week to get up-to-date information, express their opinions, and obtain help from my office and Government agencies. Laura's many additions to the site included video updates from California and the Senate floor, contests for kids on Earth Day and the Fourth of July, and dozens of links to other sites providing news, information, and assistance. 
   Laura was not only a tremendous asset to my staff; she was also a joy to work with. She was smart, funny, and most of all big hearted. She was both tech wise and user friendly, always willing to share her knowledge and expertise. In our Los Angeles office, she organized great potluck lunches where she cooked well, ate prodigiously, and shared her eclectic taste in music of all kinds--good, bad, and strange. 
   A truly urban Angeleno, Laura lived in a downtown LA loft and recently led her new husband James and their wedding party on a candlelight procession through the center city. 
   Laura was a highly skilled and devoted public servant who believed that technology can and should add to our understanding of Government and give more people the opportunity to participate in our democracy. I deeply appreciate her service to the Senate and the people of California. 
   I know Members will join me in honoring the memory of Laura Esguerra Adams and sending our thoughts and prayers to her husband, family, and many dear friends.

Officer Bailey spent almost 10 years with the California Highway Patrol, serving the citizens of California. On February 25, 2006, while on motor patrol near the City of Hesperia, Officer Bailey was struck and killed by a driver suspected to be under the influence of a controlled substance. 
   Wearing a uniform came naturally to Officer Bailey after spending 8 years in the Army as a helicopter mechanic. Even after joining the California Highway Patrol, Officer Bailey chose to serve in the California National Guard, and just returned from a 14-month tour in Iraq last fall. Officer Bailey dutifully served the citizens and communities of the Inland Empire with great dedication and integrity. He combined his love of excitement and his passion for the uniform he wore to become a very successful motorcycle officer. Officer Bailey's colleagues in the California Highway Patrol and the National Guard shall always remember his upbeat attitude, ability to motivate others, and commitment to his job. 
   Officer Bailey was a devoted family man. He is survived by his wife Teresa, and children, Megan, Jared, Hannah and Dylan. When he was not on duty, Officer Bailey was a ``true cowboy from head to toe,'' who enjoyed spending time with his family and listening to country music with his friends. Officer Gregory ``John'' Bailey served the State of California and the United States honorably and conscientiously, and fulfilled his oath as an officer of the law. Officer Bailey gave his life while protecting the safety of those he served. His contributions and dedication to law enforcement are greatly appreciated and will serve as his legacy. 
   Officer Gregory ``John'' Bailey gave his life doing what he loved to do--providing protection for the people he loved. We shall always be grateful for Officer Bailey's heroic service to the California Highway Patrol and the community that he so bravely served.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the 20th anniversary of Habitat for Humanity, Fresno. 
   Habitat for Humanity, Fresno was formed in 1985. For the past 20 years, Habitat for Humanity has been a champion in the community on behalf of those who cannot afford homes. The mission of Habitat for Humanity is to end poverty housing ``by uniting individuals, families and communities to build decent, affordable housing.'' 
   Since its inception, Habitat for Humanity, Fresno has helped build over 35 homes. The process through which it helps to build homes demonstrates its dedication to its mission. Habitat for Humanity stresses that it does not build homes for families. It facilitates the building of homes. While the difference may seem slight, it is in fact one of the sources of success for this organization. To qualify for aid from Habitat for Humanity, families must show that they are invested in building a home. This investment, or dedication, will serve as the foundation from which a house is built. 
   Habitat for Humanity chooses its families regardless of ethnicity. It provides aid to low income families who show a willingness to partner with the community. This willingness to partner serves to perpetuate an altruistic sense of participation and involvement within the community. And indeed, Habitat for Humanity is fueled by the dedication and goodwill of volunteers. 
   Since 1985, Habitat for Humanity has hosted over 7,000 volunteers. These volunteers range in age, ethnicity, gender and occupation. The diverse background of these volunteers is representative of the far reach that Habitat for Humanity has in the community. 
   The homes they construct are built with the love, strength and dedication of a community. The mission of Habitat for Humanity goes far beyond  merely building houses. Through its work in the community Habitat for Humanity not only builds houses, it builds strength within the community and confidence in its recipients. 
   I congratulate Habitat for Humanity, Fresno on the celebration of its 20th anniversary and wish them continued success.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the leadership and service of Ronald O. Loveridge, mayor of the city of Riverside. Mayor Loveridge has been honored as the 2005 Distinguished Citizen of the Inland Empire by the Inland Empire Council of Boy Scouts of America. 
   As mayor of the city of Riverside, Ron Loveridge lends his time and leadership to many organizations committed to the vitality and progress of his community. Last year, he served the State of California as president of the League of Cities. Among the organizations that have honored him for his impressive record of service are the American Planning Association, the California Preservation Foundation, the United Way, and the Youth Service Center. 
   In addition to his thoughtful leadership as mayor, Ron Loveridge has given the city of Riverside his personal commitment for 40 years. A professor of political science at the University of California, Riverside, since 1965, Dr. Ron Loveridge has used his knowledge and expertise to enrich students' understanding of and interest in the inner workings of local government. He has provided a model of conscientious citizenship, volunteering his time to advance the endeavors of the Riverside Arts Foundation, the Riverside County Philharmonic, and the Dickens Festival. 
   In 1998, Mayor Ron Loveridge was meeting with council members and staff in City Hall when a man entered and shot his gun several times. Given the circumstances, it is a miracle that no one was killed. Mayor Loveridge was hit in the back of the neck, the bullet just missing his spinal cord. I met with him just after the shooting and was amazed at his grace and good will following such an event. He has gone on to lead his city in a similar manner, always showing grace and good will even in the toughest of times. 
   I applaud Ronald Loveridge for his lifetime of public service and am pleased to invite you to join me in congratulating him as he is honored as the Boy Scouts of America Inland Empire Council's 2005 Distinguished Citizen of the Inland Empire.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life of one of the late 20th century's most influential feminists, Betty Friedan. Friedan died on February 4, 2006, at her home in Washington, DC, at the age of 85. 
   At her Smith College 15-year reunion, she famously prepared a survey of her classmates, the results of which eventually became her landmark book, ``The Feminine Mystique.'' With this book, published in 1963, Friedan helped ignite the second wave of the feminist movement, and the book is now regarded as one of the most influential American books of the 20th century. 
   Friedan was the cofounder of three groundbreaking women's organizations which have greatly improved women's economic, personal, and political lives. In 1966, Friedan cofounded the National Organization for Women, NOW, and served as its first president until 1970. She also helped found what is now NARAL Pro-Choice America and the National Women's Political Caucus. 
   Friedan fought tirelessly for equal pay, safe and legal abortion, maternity leave, childcare for working parents, and an end to sex discrimination.  
   Friedan's survivors include her sons, Daniel Friedan and Jonathan Friedan; daughter Emily Friedan; nine grandchildren; a sister, Amy Adams; and a brother, Harry Goldstein. Her former husband Carl Friedan died in December 2005. 
   Like other strong, outspoken women, Betty Friedan was widely and loudly criticized in the 1960s and 1970s for being too strong, vocal, and unrealistic. Betty Friedan endured that criticism to make her mark in the world. 
   Women have made tremendous strides since ``The Feminist Mystique'' was first published. We have a stronger voice in our communities and in our workplaces. I am proud to serve as 1 of 14 women in the Senate, and we now have 68 women in the House of Representatives. We have made progress, but much more needs to be done. 
   As we remember the life and accomplishments of Betty Friedan, let us rededicate ourselves to achieving full equality for women in America.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, California has lost a fine, young leader. Marco Antonio Firebaugh, former California Assembly majority floor leader, representing the 50th assembly district, and chair of the California Latino Legislative Caucus, recently passed away. I would like to take a few moments to recognize Marco Antonio Firebaugh's many important accomplishments and the tremendous impact he made as a leader in California. 
   Born in Baja California, Mexico, Firebaugh served three terms as a member of the California State Assembly and one term as the majority floor leader. In 1998, he was first elected to the California State Assembly, representing the 50th assembly district. During his tenure, he fought for the rights of all Californians, including immigrants and their children, with passion and great success. Under his leadership, the California State Assembly passed legislation that focused on increasing the availability of education to all California residents. 
   He led the effort to appoint more qualified Latinos and Latinas to high-level positions in State government, including the appointment of only the second Latino to serve on the California Supreme Court, the first Latina to serve as chancellor of a University of California campus, and two additional Latino presidents at the California State Universities at Fresno and Sacramento. 
   Firebaugh worked strenuously to protect and defend the dignity of his constituents, regardless of their immigration status, and remained involved in community affairs after his departure from the California State Assembly. He served as a visiting professor and policy fellow at the UCLA School of Medicine, Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture. Most recently, he decided to reenter public life, as a candidate for the California State Senate, 30th district, and gained the support of many local community leaders, including current 30th district State senator Martha Escutia. His dedication to his fellow Californians will be missed. 
   I invite all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring Marco Antonio Firebaugh for his guidance and leadership in fighting to improve the lives of all Californians. He is survived by his mother, Carmen Ramos Garcia; his children, Ariana and Nicolas; brothers, Carlos and Jesse; and sisters, Cecilia and Esmeralda.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few moments to recognize Ebony magazine as this venerable publication celebrates its 60th anniversary. 
   In 1945, at a time when segregation was the law of the land, an outlet for the positive portrayal of Black life in American popular culture was long overdue. With the birth of Ebony, Publisher John H. Johnson forced the world to consider real African Americans, including their diverse success stories. These same stories, which filled each month's edition of Ebony, gave African Americans a deeper sense of pride in their heritage and their growing prosperity. 
   Ebony also provided millions with a rich, firsthand account of key moments in the struggle for civil rights. Whether it was a sit-in at a lunch counter in the South or the historic March on Washington, the intrepid journalists and photographers of Ebony were present to bear witness and to report the news through a prism different from the mainstream press. In fact, it was an Ebony photographer who captured the now iconic photo of a grieving Coretta Scott King, with one of her children, at the funeral of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Not only did this photograph capture the emotions of a nation, but it resulted in the first Pulitzer Prize awarded to an African-American man. 
   Since Ebony was founded 60 years ago, its circulation has grown from  25,000 per issue to 1.7 million per issue, and its readership has increased from 125,000 per issue to more than 12.5 million per issue. Although it has had the largest circulation of any publication targeted to African-Americans for the duration of its existence, Ebony is much more than a magazine. As just one example, its annual fashion extravaganza, Fashion Fair, has raised more than $58 million in its 48-year history for various charities, has provided an outlet for hundreds of talented clothing designers, and created work opportunities for African-American models, as well as spawned a line of cosmetics for women of color. 
   I invite my colleagues to join me, and the millions of Americans who have been touched, inspired, and influenced by Ebony Magazine in celebrating the 60th anniversary of this great publication.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few moments to recognize the many important accomplishments of Danny J. Bakewell, Sr., as he prepares to step down as CEO of the Brotherhood Crusade. 
   Danny J. Bakewell, Sr. has spent the past 35 years building the Brotherhood Crusade into a nationally-recognized charitable organization in southern California. In that time, he has raised over $60 million to support a host of programs. Nurturing nonprofit groups and local small businesses is first and foremost among the Brotherhood Crusade's priorities. The venerable institution funds programs that provide services for adults seeking job training and job placement, young people looking to realize their academic potential, and families seeking to improve their physical health. 
   The funding that Brotherhood Crusade provides is the lifeblood for many organizations, making it possible for them to be the catalyst in bringing change to communities and change to individuals. 
   Danny's commitment to equality for all, fair representation in the media, and strengthening communities has been steadfast, as evidenced by his activist work. He was active in the struggle to bring a peaceable end to apartheid in South Africa. Danny galvanized a coalition of community leaders to change the way entertainment companies represented slavery on prime time television. Along with his family, Danny launched a foundation to uplift the lives of children during their treatments associated with leukemia and other life-threatening diseases. 
   Danny Bakewell's success in the private sector have been important to under-served communities throughout Los Angeles county as well. He is the publisher of the Los Angeles Sentinel, the largest and oldest African-American owned newspaper west of the Mississippi River. Danny was the catalyst behind two development projects--the Compton Towne Center and Compton Renaissance Plaza--which have helped to bring economic vitality into an area that had been written off by many. In addition to creating much needed jobs for community residents and additional tax revenues for the city, these projects are giving residents a deeper sense of pride in their neighborhood. 
   I invite my colleagues to join me and the thousands of people touched by his work in commending Danny J. Bakewell, Sr. for his great leadership of the Brotherhood Crusade and tireless advocacy throughout his lifetime.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize Santa Cruz County Sheriff Mark Tracy, who retired after 32 years of dedicated service. 
   Sheriff Tracy is a Santa Cruz County native who was educated in the county's public schools. In 1972, he received his bachelor of science degree in criminology from California State University at Fresno. Upon receiving his degree, Sheriff Tracy immediately returned to his home in Santa Cruz County, where he began his law enforcement career with the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office. 
   Sheriff Tracy has held many positions within the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office. As a deputy, he worked in the Patrol Division, the Coroner's Unit, and the Detention Bureau. He quickly rose through the ranks, and was soon promoted to sergeant, and then to lieutenant. In those positions, Sheriff Tracy managed the Street Narcotics and Gang units, served as the watch commander of the county jail, and supervised deputies in the Patrol Division, among other duties. Because of his expertise, Sheriff Tracy also served as the coordinator of the Search and Rescue Team, was a founding member of the Hostage Negotiating Team, and was instrumental in the planning and construction of the Roundtree Medium Security Detention Facility. In 1994, Sheriff Tracy was overwhelmingly elected by the residents of Santa Cruz County to serve as the sheriff-coroner. In 2002, he was successfully reelected, and served in the capacity of sheriff-coroner until his retirement in December 2004. 
   Among his many accomplishments, Sheriff Tracy has also served as chair of the Santa Cruz County Criminal Justice Council and the Santa Cruz County Commission on Domestic Violence. He has been an active member of the California State Sheriffs' Association and the California State Coroners' Association. Sheriff Tracy has worked tirelessly with local elected officials, schools, and community organizations to foster a strong sense of community in Santa Cruz County. I have collaborated with Sheriff Tracy in the past,  and I can attest to his commitment to the community he served. 
   Sheriff Tracy's service to the State of California and dedication to public safety is inspiring. I am confident that, even in retirement, Sheriff Tracy will continue to touch lives with his good will and compassion.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of Deputy Jerry Ortiz, a 15-year veteran of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, who was tragically killed in the line of duty on June 24, 2005. 
   As a young child growing up in Southern California, Jerry Ortiz knew that he wanted to dedicate his life to protecting his fellow citizens. So it came as no surprise when he enlisted in the U.S. Army shortly after his graduation from El Monte High School in  1988. Only 2 years later, he fulfilled his dream of becoming a police officer when he joined the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Deputy Ortiz's strict work ethic and dedication quickly made him a well-respected member of the Department and earned him a position with the elite antigang unit at the Lakewood Station. Although this was a formidable task with great responsibilities, he knew that in this capacity he could truly make a difference in the community and help at-risk youth. Deputy Ortiz did just that. 
   Jerry Ortiz was an important part of the Sheriff's Department family. He was well known for his sense of humor, positive attitude, and athleticism on the Department boxing team. Over his 15-year career, he became an integral part of the fight against gang crime in the area and went above and beyond to protect the innocent citizens caught in the unfortunate gang violence in their communities. Days before his tragic murder, Deputy Ortiz received word that he was being promoted to detective. 
   All who knew him said that he loved his job but that he was first and foremost a family man. Ortiz spent most of his free time with his two sons, Jeremy, 16, and Jacob, 6. He was a sports fan and enjoyed sharing this passion with his sons. Only three weeks before his death, Jerry Ortiz married his wife, Chela, and those close to him say he was happier than ever. 
   I am truly saddened to lose this remarkable public servant. Deputy Jerry Ortiz died doing what he loved--providing protection for his community. He was a leader, an inspiring mentor, a hero, and a wonderful father and husband. We will always be grateful for Deputy Ortiz's heroic service to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the community that he so bravely served.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a dual celebration for the city of Kerman, CA. This year marks the 100th anniversary of Kerman as a city in Fresno County and also the 60th anniversary of its incorporation as an official city. 
   In 1891, the Southern Pacific Railroad Company constructed a new line between Tracy and Fresno. A nondescript watering tank and pump along  that line was given the name Collis as a tribute to Collis P. Huntington, a member of the famed ``Big Four'' of western railroading. The first inhabitant, the caretaker of the pump and tank, resigned his job after just a few months, not because of the demands of the job but, rather, because the area was too desolate and barren. 
   As a speculative venture, the Bank of California purchased a large tract of land in every county in California. The arid land around what became Kerman was chosen as the allotment for Fresno County. After the death of its promoter, the once prominent bank became insolvent and its holdings were liquidated. In 1910, the property in Fresno County caught the attention of two Los Angeles capitalists, William G. Kerckoff and Jacob Mansar, who saw the tract as an opportunity to purchase a rich water supply from the newly constructed Enterprise Canal. Mr. Kerckoff and Mr. Mansar combined the first three letters of their names and renamed the area ``Kerman.'' 
   Since its incorporation in 1946, Kerman has experienced steady growth while retaining its identity and character as a predominately agrarian community. Today, Kerman has joined with other thriving cities on the west side of Fresno County along the Interstate 5 corridor by reaching out to industry through the development of an industrial park. 
   From a remote outpost that was once deemed too isolated for a watering tank operator to one of the fastest growing cities in Fresno County, the city of Kerman has served as a shining example to the importance of agriculture in California and also to the virtues of community spirit and diversity. 
   As the residents of Kerman continue to work together to make their city a better place to call home, I congratulate them on their auspicious dual landmark anniversaries and wish them continued success and good fortune.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize California State University, San Bernardino, CSUSB. This academic year, the campus celebrates its 40th anniversary. 
   San Bernardino-Riverside State College was founded in 1960 and was named California State College at San Bernardino when it opened on September 28, 1965. At that time, only 293 students were enrolled. In 1984, the campus gained university status and became California State University, San Bernardino. 
   Today, CSUSB can look back on 40 years of growth as a successful university that has graduated more than 55,000 students, with an enrollment of over 16,400, with about 3,500 annual graduates. Additionally, Cal State San Bernardino boasts of 5 academic colleges, offering more than 70 degree and certificate programs.  
   Cal State San Bernardino is an asset to the local economy as well. The university provides direct and indirect employment to approximately 10,000 people in the local region, supporting healthy economic growth in the Inland Empire. 
   CSUSB is a leader in student diversity, with one of the most diverse student bodies in the California State University system. The Robert V. Fullerton Art Museum, which is located on campus, is a significant cultural institution throughout all of southern California, bringing an important cultural contribution with its impressive ancient and contemporary collections. 
   CSUSB faculty and staff also provide important research in the Inland Empire. The university has many research and service facilities that include the Water Resources Institute, Developmental Disabilities Center, Institute of Applied Research, Diversity Institute, Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship, International Institute, Arrowhead Laboratory for Securities Analysis, Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, Institute for Child Development and Family Relations, Office for the Commercialization of Advanced Technology, Office of National Excellence in Distance Learning, and the Community-University Partnership. 
   While located in San Bernardino, the university is working to provide higher education in the Coachella Valley, a traditionally underserved area. The university has built a branch campus in Palm Desert, which provides much needed access to higher education in this rapidly growing region. 
   I applaud the service and dedication of the staff and students of California State University, San Bernardino as they celebrate 40 years of improving the education and lives of the people of the Inland Empire and desert region of southern California.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Self-Help Enterprises. Self-Help is an organization that helps low-income families build their own homes. Now in its 40th year, Self-Help Enterprises has been instrumental in building over 5,000 new homes in the San Joaquin Valley. 
   As its name implies, Self-Help aids families that try to help themselves. The mission of Self-Help Enterprises stresses that of personal responsibility, pride in ownership and community. Through its various programs Self-Help not only helps to build houses, it builds communities. 
   To qualify for help a family must demonstrate that it is committed to building their own home and that it is dedicated to helping others in the community. In this way, Self-Help ensures that a sense of community is built. Families receive counseling through every step of the home building process and are taught, not shown, how to build a house so that they may take pride in their work. Each family must contribute at least 40 hours of ``sweat equity'' a week towards building their home, with a total of 1,300-1,500 hours of labor. Self-Help calls this sweat equity the family's down payment. Families are organized into groups of 10 or 12. From these groups families work to build each others' homes. Through cooperative work Self-Help Enterprises helps an average of 150 families build homes each year. 
   Self-Help Enterprises also works on Community Development Projects designed to improve the infrastructure present in low-income neighborhoods. Similarly, Self-Help rehabilitates older homes to help families keep homes that may be run-down, and makes homes safer to live in. To date, Self-Help has rehabilitated 5,000 homes, renovated 20,000 water and sewer connections, and weather-proofed 40,000 homes. 
   Self-Help understands the importance of providing affordable housing to families. For families who cannot own a home, Self-Help develops multi-family housing projects and establishes rent levels and financing plans to give low-income families a chance to raise their children in a safe and secure environment. 
   In its mission statement, Self-Help Enterprises states that all families really need is ``someone to bridge the gulf between dreams and reality.'' Self-Help is that bridge. I congratulate Self-Help Enterprises on their 40th anniversary and wish them many more years of continued success.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the distinguished public service of David L. Crow. After 15 years at the helm of the largest air-pollution control district in the Nation, he will soon retire as the air pollution control officer and executive director of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, SJAPCD. During his tenure, the district grew from a fledgling union of regional air boards into one of the Nation's most active air-pollution control districts. 
   After completing his undergraduate and graduate studies at California State University, Fullerton, David built a solid resume in public service before he assumed the leadership of the SJAPCD in 1991. He served as the acting city manager for Foster City, CA, budget director and director of policy development for Fresno County, as well as deputy county administrative officer for Fresno County before lending his considerable talents to improving air quality in the Central Valley. 
   David accepted the challenge to address and solve the air-quality issues in a region that perennially rank among the worst nationwide in summertime smog and wintertime particulate pollution. Under his stewardship, the Valley air basin has made great strides in reducing ozone exceedances, as it has seen a 50-percent reduction in the emissions from statutory sources. The SJAPCD has implemented programs such as the ``Check Before You Burn'' winter wood-burning restriction program; a system to reduce smoke emissions from agricultural burning, and creating cost-effective rules to encourage conservation management practices for farms. 
   During his tenure as the head of the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, David has earned a reputation as a skilled consensus-builder who forged partnerships between interests which seldom agreed. Under his leadership, the air-pollution district has distributed over $100 million to implement a myriad of projects to reduce serious air pollution in the region. David Crow's efforts, and those of the talented staff that he helped build, are helping to improve the air quality in California's Central Valley, one of the fastest growing regions in the Nation. 
   Throughout his career, David Crow has proven to be a highly effective administrator who was committed to protecting the public's health. As he gets set to spend more time with his wife Vicky and sons, Ryan and Matthew, I wish him continued success and good luck in all his future endeavors.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Mr. William H. (Harry) Armstrong on receiving the 2005 Rose Ann Vuich Ethical Leadership Award. The Rose Ann Vuich Leadership Award, sponsored by the Kenneth L.  Maddy Institute at California State University, Fresno, the Fresno Business Council and the Fresno Bee, is a prestigious award that celebrates excellence and integrity in public service. 
   Harry Armstrong began his distinguished career in public service when he was appointed to the Clovis Planning Commission in 1966. In 1970, Harry was elected by the residents of Clovis to serve on the city council for nine consecutive terms. During this period, Harry also completed four highly successful terms as the mayor of Clovis. He is currently the longest-serving councilmember in California. 
   Harry Armstrong's remarkable tenure on city council has coincided with the growth of Clovis from a quiet small town to one of the most vibrant and dynamic communities in the Central Valley. Clovis' status as one of the most desirable places to live, raise a family, and conduct business is made possible in no small part by Harry's extraordinary vision and steadfast commitment to serve the overall good of the community and advance the interests of his beloved constituents. 
   In addition to his immense contributions to the city of Clovis, Harry Armstrong has been very generous in lending his considerable talents and passion for public service to a number of other statewide and regional causes over the years. A former president of the League of California Cities, Harry is the current chairperson of the Fresno County Transportation Authority as well as serving in the same capacity for the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies. Harry is widely regarded as one of the Central Valley's foremost experts on transportation and water issues. 
   As important is the high level of ethical leadership that has been the hallmark of Harry Armstrong's tenure of public service. 
   As his colleagues, constituents, and many admirers would attest, Harry Armstrong is a truly deserving recipient of an award that honors the importance of integrity, character, ethics, consensus building, and commitment to the common good in public service. Throughout his career in government, Harry has consistently embodied the best ideals of a dedicated public servant. 
   I congratulate Harry Armstrong on receiving the 2005 Rose Ann Vuich Ethical Leadership Award and wish him continued success in his future endeavors.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the Pontifical Visit of His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia, to my home State of California in October, 2005. 
   The Catholicos represents the Great House of Cilicia, an historic Armenian religious center established in 1441. The Catholicosate was relocated to Antelias, Lebanon following the atrocities of the Armenian Genocide, which included destruction of houses of worship in Cilicia. Today, His Holiness Aram I represents hundreds of thousands of Armenian American Christians, as well as Armenians across the Near East. The Armenian faith is 1,700 years old and it is significant that Armenia was the first nation to officially adopt Christianity as a state religion in 301 AD. 
   The Catholicos' spiritual, cultural and educational influence extends well beyond the Armenian people. His Holiness Aram I, who holds a Master of Divinity, a Master of Sacred Theology, a Ph.D., and several honorary degrees, has authored numerous articles and texts in Armenian, English and French, some of which have been translated into other languages. The Catholicos has worked to strengthen interfaith relations between Christian and Muslim communities. In 1974, the Catholicos was one of the founding members of the Middle East Council of Churches. 
   His Holiness Aram I was elected as Moderator of the Central and Executive Committees of the World Council of Churches, WCC, a renowned organization which represents over 400 million Christians worldwide. The WCC brings together over 340 churches and denominations in more than 100 countries throughout the world. The Catholicos is the first Orthodox, first Middle Easterner and youngest person to hold this position and his unanimous re-election as Moderator in 1998 was exceptional in the history of the WCC. 
   During his trip to California, which is titled ``Towards the Light of Knowledge,'' the Catholicos will visit churches as well as educational and cultural institutions in Los Angeles, Fresno and San Francisco. This momentous visit was initiated by His Eminence, Archbishop Moushegh Mardirossian of the  Western Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America to commemorate the 90th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide and the 1600th Anniversary of the creation of the Armenian alphabet. 
   I am honored to recognize this milestone visit to California by a distinguished Armenian and world leader. I wish both the Catholicos and the Armenian community in California a renewed sense of purpose and inspiration from this visit.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor the memory of a most dedicated public servant, California Assemblyman Mike Gordon. Assemblyman Gordon passed away on June 25, 2005. He was 47 years old. 
   Assemblyman Gordon began his political career at the young age of 18 as a voter registration coordinator for Assembly Speaker Leo McCarthy and later joined the staff of Assemblyman Bruce Young (D-Downey). In 1982, Gordon began his 3-year tenure as executive director of the California Democratic Party and in 1995 co-founded Gordon and Schwenkmeyer, Inc., a successful polling and fundraising firm that is still operating today. 
   Mike Gordon was elected to the El Segundo City Council in 1996 and as the city's mayor in 1998, 2000, and 2002. During this time, he focused on revitalizing El Segundo's downtown and helped increase funding for police, fire and recreation. As cofounder of the Los Angeles Air Force Base Alliance, he fought against the closure of the base and focused his attention on finding a solution for regional air and road traffic. Of all his great work as councilman and mayor, Mike's focus on education and funding for the El Segundo Unified School District made him a hero in the community. 
   In 2004, Mike Gordon ran successfully for the 53rd California Assembly seat in the South Bay of Los Angeles County. Assemblyman Gordon introduced 22 bills during his first 2 months in the assembly and was appointed chair of the Assembly Committee on Veterans Affairs and as the body's representative to California's Milton Marks Little Hoover Commission. His strong leadership skills and passion for public service were instrumental in his early success in the assembly. 
   Assemblyman Mike Gordon knew firsthand the concerns and needs of his community and dedicated his life to serving the citizens of Southern California. He grew up in La Mirada, CA where he attended Neff High School and in 1979 graduated from California State University, Fullerton with a bachelor's degree in political science. Whether as mayor or assemblyman, he used his knowledge, influence, and skills to better the lives of his constituents. 
   Assemblyman Gordon is survived by his wife Denise and children, Ryan, Erika, Amanda, and Gordy. He was a deeply loved member of both the California State Legislature and the South Bay community for his willingness to champion the causes of those he represented. He will be missed by all who knew him.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the lifetime of achievement of Hardy L. Brown. His story is a true American success story and he stands today as a leader in his community. 
   Hardy L. Brown was born in Trenton, NC, in 1942, the son of a sharecropper. After graduating from high school, Hardy Brown relocated to California where he found work as a laborer for Kaiser Steel in Fontana. He did not remain a laborer for long, and, in time, he took a management position with Kaiser Steel. During this same time, he also became actively involved with many community projects, always with a focus on community service. 
   Hardy Brown was elected to the San Bernardino City Unified School District's Board in 1983 and served for 12 years. He served as president of the board and was the first African-American male to hold this position. During his tenure as board president, he was responsible for the re-opening of and the changing of names of two schools on the west side of San Bernardino. 
   The banner of The Black Voice News, a weekly news publication focusing on issues surrounding the African American community, claims, ``The Black Voice News, serving the Inland Empire for 30 years.'' Cheryl and Hardy have, in fact, owned and operated the newspaper and served the Inland Empire for 28 of those successful years. He has also served on the board of the West Coast Black Publishers Association and has been active in the National Newspaper Publishers Association, which named him Publisher of the Year in 2000. He also has served as president of the California Black Media Association, an advocacy alliance for Black-owned newspapers, magazines, and radio stations. 
   Hardy L. Brown has had a lasting impact on southern California both through his public service and through his weekly publications. His advice and counsel are often sought by leaders in education, and by civic leaders and by Members of Congress. In fact, Hardy served on the staff of the late Congressman George E. Brown, Jr. in the Inland Empire. He and his wife, Cheryl, provide an important and reliable progressive voice and insight to the community. I applaud Hardy L. Brown for his lifetime of public service and community leadership and I am pleased to honor him as he celebrates his 63rd birthday. Please join me in honoring a great American and a true community hero, Hardy L. Brown.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor George Wingate High School in Brooklyn, NY. Wingate High School, my alma mater, will graduate its last class on June 27, 2006. 
   In 1954, Wingate High School accepted its first class of students and had its first graduating class in 1957. It was the first high school built in New York after the end of World War II, and it embodied many of the ideals of the baby boomer generation. Wingate High School was so different from the standard design plan for schools that it became known as ``The Banjo School'' because of its open design. 
   Wingate High School was also innovative in its approach to teaching. Instead of focusing strictly on academic classes, Wingate was one of the first high schools in the Nation to offer a comprehensive range of classes in vocational, commercial and academic fields. Wingate High School has been known for its outstanding aviation, culinary arts, nursing and law programs, and many of its students have gone on to become successful pilots, chefs, nurses and attorneys. 
   Wingate has had a few famous graduates such as former New York State senator and current Brooklyn Borough president, Marty Markowitz, and Roger Brown, a New York City playground legend who went on to greatness in the American Basketball Association. However, thousands of other Wingate graduates have made priceless contributions to their communities, in part because of the valuable lessons they learned there. 
   I firmly believe that a quality education is the key to our youths' success and our nation's future. I commend Wingate's teachers, faculty, staff, and volunteers for their many years of hard work and dedication to Wingate High School's students. Their work has resulted in thousands of students who are better prepared to face the world and its challenges. I commend them for their commitment to quality education. Their enthusiasm and love of teaching means a brighter future for all of our children. 
   Wingate High School's motto is: ``Ad Astra per Ardua''--``To the stars through struggle.'' In its 52-year history, George Wingate High School has graduated thousands of students who have gone on to make the world a better place. Though the journey has not always been easy, I know that Wingate's 2006 graduates will go on to do great things. 
   I give my most sincere congratulations and best wishes for the future to Wingate High School's Class of 2006.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a remarkable citizen of my home State of California, Mr. Manuel Portillo, as National City dedicates the Casa de Salud Manuel Portillo Youth Center in his honor. 
   Throughout his lifetime, Mr. Portillo has played an exemplary role in empowering and improving the lives of children and young adults throughout the San Diego community. His tireless efforts to improve his beloved community and his selfless service to our Nation has made a tangible difference for countless people. The will and vision of Mr. Portillo serves as an inspiration to us all. 
   Born in 1920, Mr. Portillo rose from humble beginnings to become a leader in the San Diego community. As a youth, he developed a passion for the sport of boxing that he still enjoys today. At age 12, he was earning 25 cents an hour picking celery, yet the strength of character for which he has come to be known was only just beginning to emerge. By 17, Portillo was working for the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping develop bridges and campgrounds, many of which are still in use today throughout the State, including in Yosemite National Park. 
   In 1942, only 30 days after being married, Portillo was drafted by the U.S. Army and sent to join the Allied struggle in Europe during the height of World War II. While serving in the Army, Portillo honed his boxing skills to a fine art and often challenged his fellow soldiers. Portillo returned to National City after being honorably discharged and after receiving four bronze service stars as a Sergeant in Company A 378th Infantry. 
   After returning home, Portillo dedicated himself to improving his community by establishing positive programs for otherwise troubled neighborhood youth. He was able to keep many of these kids off the streets and out of trouble by teaching them the sport of boxing. With an emphasis on sportsmanship and discipline, Portillo has made a positive impact in the lives of countless children and young adults. His success inspired the creation of the Casa Knight, the Casa Men's Club, Santos and Peewees for boys, and the Knightetts. These recreational groups have become fundamental vehicles for social mobility, encouraging positive self-image and motivation in both an extracurricular and academic capacity. 
   It is with great pleasure that I commend Manuel Portillo for his passionate commitment to helping others and tireless efforts to improve the broader San Diego community. I wish him great success in the future.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the dedication of the Federal courthouse building in Fresno, CA, which is to occur October 18. 
   The magnificent Federal courthouse building will provide the much-needed space and capacity to effectively serve a region that is continuing to grow at a rapid rate. This building will help ensure the swift and efficient administration of justice to the people of the Fresno Division of the Eastern District, which covers the counties of Calaveras, Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Kings, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Stanislaus, Tulare, and Tuolumne. Furthermore, this impressive edifice will be the most tangible and powerful symbol of the American justice system to the people of the region. 
   In addition to meeting the needs of the court for additional space and related purposes, the Federal courthouse building will be a centerpiece and catalyst for the continued renaissance of downtown Fresno. The strikingly designed courthouse stands as part of the downtown skyline that continues to grow. I am particularly pleased that the Federal Government has been an integral partner in downtown revitalization with this and other projects. Together, they have brought thousands of employees to the area. I applaud the efforts of all those in the community who, through their commitment and dedication, helped make this latest addition to the downtown Fresno landscape a reality. 
   I hope this courthouse will ultimately be named for Senior U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle, a man who is widely and greatly admired and respected for his work as a judge. Judge Coyle has had a distinguished career as an attorney and on the bench. Appointed to California's Eastern Court in 1982, Judge Coyle has served the Eastern District for 20 years, including 6 years as a senior judge. 
   For over a decade, Judge Coyle has been a tireless champion of the effort to build this courthouse. He has been seen daily walking to and from the building site assuring that the job was done right, which I am proud to report is certainly the case. A courthouse building named in his honor will stand as a testament to the people of California of the distinguished career and the dedicated work of Judge Robert E. Coyle. 
   I am proud to commemorate the dedication of the Federal courthouse building in Fresno, and wish its occupants and the people of the Fresno Division of the Eastern District a bright future as we continue to work to bring justice and equality to all.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to take a few moments to recognize the tremendous accomplishments of the Westside Center for Independent Living, WCIL, based in Santa Monica and Los Angeles, as this unique organization celebrates its 30th year of service.  
   WCIL has devoted innumerable hours and incredible effort toward giving senior citizens and members of our community with disabilities the gift of independence. The WCIL was founded in 1976 during the height of the ``independent living movement.'' Originating in Berkeley in 1970, the independent living movement has strived to provide disabled persons with the opportunity to manage their own lives. Today, centers such as the WCIL have become a vital staple of urban life across the Nation. 
   Through an array of innovative methods, the center allows seniors and disabled persons to become more fully integrated into our community. One such technique is the peer training system, whereby veterans of the independence training program share their tested knowledge with people who are new to the program. Such pairing instills a sense of confidence in new participants, as it lets them know that they are not alone and that others like them have succeeded in leading a more independent life. 
   WCIL's Advocacy Action Group works with the disabled community and elected officials to modernize existing disability legislation. The group collects the ideas and complaints of disabled people and transforms them into substantive legislation. Through true grassroots campaigning and issue advocacy, the group ensures that elected officials stay abreast of current accessibility issues in their community. 
   Recognizing the necessity for information regarding accessibility throughout Los Angeles, the WCIL, in partnership with UCLA, has established Living Independently in Los Angeles, LILA. LILA provides a host of useful information regarding the accessibility of public and private places, community organizations working for the betterment of those with disabilities, and advocacy groups. Thanks to LILA, numerous disabled persons are better equipped to navigate Los Angeles. 
   The center provides invaluable educational services, including public awareness about the Americans with Disabilities Act. Countless businesses, community organizations, and local community members credit WCIL for helping them to ensure that buildings and offices are accessible for Americans with disabilities. 
   I am pleased to join the thousands of beneficiaries of this important organization in commending the Westside Center for Independent Living. The Center's work has bettered the lives of countless disabled and senior citizens and has enabled them to participate more fully in our community. The center's efforts have clearly shown that ``a disability need not be disabling.''

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the opening of the University of California, Merced, the first new University of California campus in 40 years. 
   The University of California, Merced is the 10th campus in the University of California system, widely renowned as one of the finest public university systems in the world. Merced, located in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley in Central California, was selected as the site of the new campus in 1995 after a thorough and competitive screening process that took 7 years and involved more than 80 different locations. 
   The 1,000 students in the inaugural 2005 class are a shining example of the diversity that is a great strength of California. Students from Del Norte to San Diego, and from the Pacific Coast to the Sierra Nevada, make up the diverse student body population. A significant number of the students are the first in their families to attend college and come from underrepresented ethnic or racial minority groups in the Central Valley. 
   The University of California, Merced will grow steadily in the coming years. Initially, the university will offer major degrees in nine different majors from three disciplines: engineering, natural sciences, and social sciences, arts and humanities. Graduate degrees in the three major disciplines will also be available. Total enrollment is expected to reach 5,000 in 5 years and reach 25,000 in 2035. The number of academic programs and degree offerings will increase accordingly as the university grows. 
   The students, faculty, and staff of the inaugural UC Merced class deserve special praise for their vision as they take on the responsibility of building and expanding the 10th University of California to one that will some day be steep in tradition, history, and excellence. In due time, the students, faculty, and the staff of the first UC Merced class will be rightfully seen as pioneers to those who will follow in their path in the years and decades to come. 
   The opening of the University of California, Merced is made possible by the tireless work and dedication of scores of committed public officials, hard-working professionals, and determined citizens. Every person who has lent a helping hand to the UC Merced campus can take great pride in knowing that their hard work has resulted in greater opportunities for future generations of California students. 
   I congratulate the University of California, Merced on its opening, and wish its faculty, students and the community a bright future as they help make the Central Valley and California an even better place to live.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor the memory of one of California's great labor leaders and dedicated social justice activists, Frank Souza. Frank passed away on February 19, 2005. He was 79 years old.  
   Frank Souza was born in New Bedford, MA in 1925. In 1948, he and his wife Virginia drove across the country to California in search of better job opportunities. Upon his arrival, he took a job with Greyhound as a bus mechanic, and worked there for 13 years. In 1953, Frank became involved in the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO. 
   When I first met Frank many years ago, before I was in elected office, I was struck by his kindness and dedication to working people. That kindness and dedication grew with each passing year. Frank's commitment to social justice earned him the trust and respect of fellow labor activists and allowed him to rise quickly through the ranks at the machinists union. It was not long before Frank was a nationally known leader of the machinists union in northern California. In his capacity as Directing Business Representative of District 190, the largest automotive district of the machinists union in America, Frank was a constant source of pride for both his fellow machinists and the community at large. 
   Although Frank retired in 1989 after 25 years with the machinists union, he remained an active union leader, holding impressive positions as a machinists union delegate to the National AFL-CIO, vice president of the California Labor Federation for the AFL-CIO, chair of the Western States Trucking Committee for the National Auto Transporters, chair for the Sea Land West Coast negotiating committee, and treasurer for the California Alliance of Retired Americans. 
   It is not just Frank's accomplishments in the field of labor that made him stand out. Frank was one of the most wonderful people that I have come in contact with in all of my years of public service. His warmth and intelligence were a true inspiration to me. When he talked to me about injustice in the workplace, or in the world, his eyes would tear up. I knew that I could never let him down. 
   Frank Souza was a deeply loved labor leader who championed the causes of America's working families, not only in this country, but throughout the world. We can take comfort in knowing that future generations will benefit from his spirit, his vision, and his leadership. He taught us about the dignity and soul of working people, and in his memory we won't forget.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I rise to honor the memory of the late Buck Owens, the Country Music Hall of Fame honoree who introduced a uniquely California sound to country music. Mr. Owens, a long time Bakersfield resident, passed away at his home on March 25, 2006. He was 76 years old. 
   Alvis Edgar Owens, Jr. was born in Sherman, TX, in 1932. At an early age, he nicknamed himself, ``Buck,'' after a mule on the family farm. Seeking better fortune during the Great Depression, the Owens family moved west in 1937, settling in Mesa, AZ. 
   An avid music fan, Buck learned to play the guitar in his early teens. By his late teens, he was already a regular on local radio stations and was playing shows in honky tonks and bars around Phoenix. A precocious and determined young man, it was apparent to many that Buck was a prodigiously talented musician who was destined for great success. 
   Buck's many accomplishments amassed over a five-decade recording and performing career have rightfully cemented his status as one of the greatest country-western entertainers ever. He was truly a trailblazer whose trademark stinging electric guitar and rhythm sound revolutionized country music. Buck's 21 country singles from 1963 to 1988 were a testament to his longevity and staying power. Buck's music was universally celebrated and embraced, as evidence by the Beatles' cover of his song, ``Act Naturally'' in 1965. The consummate entertainer, Buck's iconic television entertainment show, ``Hee Haw'' enjoyed a remarkable 25 year run on the airwaves. 
   I was delighted to have met Buck back in 1997 at his Crystal Palace in Bakersfield. He was kind and generous of spirit, as when I was invited to present one of his special red, white, and blue guitars to a promising music student named William Villatoro. I still vividly remember how the young man was deeply moved and inspired by his generous gesture. I will certainly remember Buck Owens as a man of great compassion who possessed a profound love for his country. Although he is no longer with us, I take great comfort in knowing that Buck Owens was not only able to be a shining light in the life of a young man from Bakersfield, but also to the millions of others who admired his musical gifts and were touched by his humanity. 
   Buck Owens has left behind a legacy of artistry and boundless love for his adopted hometown of Bakersfield and California's Central Valley. He will be dearly missed. 
   Buck Owens is survived by his three sons, Buddy Alan, Michael, and Johnny.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I celebrate the grand opening of the Rotary Clubs of Modesto Centennial Junction section of the Virginia Corridor and to recognize the United Rotary Clubs of Modesto's extraordinary contributions and support for the Virginia Corridor Rails-to-Trails project. When I visited the site in July of 2002, the Virginia Corridor was very much just an idea. However, as a result of the hard work of a number of city officials and staff members, and the determination of a group of motivated citizens, the entire Virginia Corridor will soon become a reality. 
   The United Rotary Clubs of Modesto, an organization that played an instrumental role to this project, is comprised of the five local Rotary clubs: the Modesto Rotary Club, the Modesto East Rotary Club, the Modesto Gateway Rotary Club, the Modesto North Rotary Club, and the Modesto Sunrise Rotary Club. Together, the local rotary clubs contributed significant funding for the trail segment between Roseburg and Orangeburg Avenues. The rotary clubs donated and installed lighting, a 10-foot wide asphalt trail surface, a kiosk, fencing and irrigation. This quarter mile trail, which will be known as the Rotary Clubs of Modesto Centennial Junction of the Virginia Corridor, features a trail with lighting, landscaping, benches, picnic tables and seat walls. 
   The Virginia Corridor Rails-to-Trails project is a truly collaborative effort between the city of Modesto, the State of California, the Federal Government, and a host of local community interests that, once completed, will successfully transform a once abandoned rail corridor into a premier linear park, trail and recreational gathering place in one of the fastest growing cities in California's Central Valley. 
   When completed, the Virginia Corridor will stretch nearly 4 miles from Modesto's central business district to the northern boundary of the city. Once completed, this trail will link neighborhoods by providing a safe and scenic commuter route to schools, parks, and restaurants for bicyclists and pedestrians. The Virginia Corridor will also offer a place for Modesto's outdoor enthusiasts to pursue a myriad of outdoor activities, as it will link three primary bike paths that include: the Hetch Hetchy Trail in North Modesto, the class I trails in Dry Creek Regional Park and the Tuolumne River Regional Park. 
   I congratulate the city of Modesto on the opening of the Rotary Clubs of Modesto Centennial Junction of the Virginia Corridor. I especially commend the invaluable contributions of the United Rotary Clubs of Modesto which, through their generosity and commitment to public service, have provided a community jewel that will go a long way towards improving the quality of life for the people of Modesto.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened to inform you of the passing of Bill Robertson, former secretary treasurer for the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. I would like to take a few moments to recognize Bill Robertson's many important accomplishments and the tremendous impact he made on the labor movement. 
   Born in St. Paul, MN, Bill Robertson was a man with humble beginnings. He lost both his parents when he was a child and lived in an orphanage for a brief period. Growing up in difficult circumstances in the middle of the Great Depression shaped Bill's social and personal beliefs. He intimately understood the struggle that working men and women faced to achieve dignity in the United States. 
   Bill led the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor for nearly two decades. During his tenure, he fought for the rights of working people with passion and great success. In 1975, Bill  Robertson became secretary-treasurer for the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. Under his leadership, The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor saw phenomenal growth. He coordinated many successful labor rights victories and spent a great deal of time building the labor movement and fighting for fairness and equality. In addition to his efforts to further the labor movement, Bill Robertson took steps to assist the city of Los Angeles' homeless population. In the winter of 1985, the city of Los Angeles had authorized a temporary tent shelter to be erected for the city's homeless population. Bill Robertson found this solution to be inadequate and successfully persuaded then Mayor Tom Bradley to authorize construction of a temporary structure to house the 138-bed shelter. Bill Robertson rallied volunteer laborers and secured union funds to buy the construction materials. 
   Bill also played a major role in bringing prominence and recognition to the city of Los Angeles. In addition to assisting city officials with securing the rights to host the 1984 Olympic Games, Bill also played a pivotal role in establishing a home for a professional football team in Los Angeles. It was through his role as chief negotiator in the $6.7-million deal in 1980 that brought the Raiders football team from Oakland to the Los Angeles Coliseum. Bill Robertson considered this achievement as one of the proudest of his career. 
   I invite all of my colleagues to join me and the many members of the labor community in recognizing and honoring Bill Robertson for his guidance and lifelong effort in fighting to improve the lives of working people. He is survived by his wife, Dresden Graham Robertson; his two sons, William and Robert; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a wonderful organization in my home State of California, MANA de San Diego, as it celebrates its 20th anniversary. 
   MANA de San Diego is one of 20 regional chapters throughout the United States operating under the auspices of the MANA National Latina Organization. MANA, short for hermana, or sister in Spanish, was founded in 1974 by Mexican-American women and was later expanded to include Latinas of all descent. Today, it serves as the single largest organization of Latinas in the United States. MANA provides an important voice for women at local, State, and national levels. 
   The San Diego Chapter of MANA, founded in 1986, has played an important role in the civic development of San Diego's large Latina community. In 2000, Latinas made up 12.5 percent of San Diego's population of more than 2.8 million. MANA de San Diego encourages its members to actively participate on boards, commissions, and with civic and educational organizations in order to improve the quality of life for all San Diegans. Each year, MANA de San Diego recognizes local women in the law, education, government, and education at a ``Brindis'' or toast event. The ``Brindis'' not only helps to raise money for the scholarship program but brings together successful women and students. 
   Through a variety of programs, such as the mentorship program ``Hermanitas,'' MANA de San Diego empowers Latinas and encourages educational pursuits. The program exposes young women to arts and culture, higher education opportunities, careers, and leadership opportunities they might not otherwise experience. Hermanitas participants tour major universities in San Diego to help them visualize where they can attend school. Since 1991, MANA de San Diego has given more than $140,000 in scholarships to Latinas. This is particularly important given that Latinas drop out of high school at a higher rate than any other group in the United States. In addition, MANA de San Diego promotes increased awareness of Latina health issues through its Annual Women's Health Fair. 
   Recently, MANA de San Diego partnered with Girl Scouts San Diego- Imperial Council to create the Cesar Chavez Community Service patch. The purpose was to create a patch to honor and encourage Girl Scouts to learn about Cesar Chavez. Girl Scouts throughout the Nation will be able to earn a new patch in recognition of outstanding community service. The students in the Hermanitas program worked closely with their mentors and the council to design this patch. Together, they created the rules to award the patch. 
   Organizations such as MANA should be recognized for the critical role they play in strengthening the Latina community in California and the United States. I salute the women of MANA de San Diego for their passionate commitment to the advancement of Latinas and tireless efforts to improve the broader San Diego Community. I wish the organization great success in the future.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the Pontifical Visit of His Holiness Karekin II, Catholicos of All Armenians, to the Western Diocese of the Armenian Church of North America during the month of June 2005. The Catholicos will visit the Western Diocese, headquartered in Burbank in my home State of California and travel around California from June 1 through 20. As the 132nd Catholicos of all Armenians, His Holiness Karekin II is spiritual leader to more than 7 million Armenian Apostolic Christians worldwide. I would also like to recognize the Western Diocese Primate, His Eminence Archbishop Hovnan Derderian, for his good works on behalf of Armenian-Americans in California and the Western U.S. 
   This momentous occasion marks the second Pontifical visit of the Catholicos to the Western Diocese. The visit has been titled ``The Renaissance of Faith'' because it marks a source of spiritual inspiration and reawakening for Christian Armenians, whose faith is 1700 years old. 
   The Diocese of the Armenian Church, established 107 years ago in Worcester, MA, originally served Armenian churches in the United States and Canada. In 1927, the Western Diocese of the Armenian Church of North America was established by a directive from the Mother See. The establishment of the Western Diocese was an historic occasion, which marked the growth of a strong Armenian community in California and the Western United States. 
   The Western Diocese was originally headquartered in Fresno. In 1957, the headquarters were moved to Los Angeles. In 1994, the headquarters were damaged by the Northridge Earthquake. Later that year, the Diocesan Assembly decided to purchase a new Diocesan Headquarters. In 1997, the Western Diocese officially moved into a multipurpose complex located in Burbank, CA, which will be the future site of the Mother Cathedral. This Pontifical visit is even more special because the Catholicos will be there in June to bless the foundation stones at the groundbreaking of the new Mother Cathedral. 
   The visit is also appropriately timed to coincide with two important anniversaries--the 90th Anniversary of the commemoration of the Armenian Genocide and the 1600th Anniversary of the creation of the Armenian alphabet. Earlier this year, I joined my Armenian friends in commemorating the 90th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, which was the first genocide of the 20th century. 
   The Armenian alphabet, along with the Armenian language, has contributed immensely to the vibrant continuity of Armenian culture. The Catholicos' visit will highlight these two anniversaries and further empower Armenians in the Western Diocese to continue their long-fought efforts for justice. 
   I am honored to recognize this historic and joyous visit, which will strengthen ties between Armenia and Armenians in California. I know that His Holiness Karekin II will have a very special visit to California and I wish the Armenian community in California an increased sense of purpose and inspiration.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to honor and share with my colleagues the memory of a very special woman, Alice Yarish of Marin County, who died May 9, 2005. She was 96 years old. 
   Alice Yarish was an award-winning reporter and the Grande Dame of Marin journalism. I knew her during the 11 years she worked for the Pacific Sun, exposing political scandals and pushing for prison reform. 
   During her years as a journalist in Marin, Alice demonstrated personal courage and a strong commitment to social justice. Alice is most well known for her relentless coverage of prison reform and she continued to fight for prisoner rights and prison reform until her retirement from the Pacific Sun in 1981. 
   She went on to write her autobiography, ``Growing Old Disgracefully: Adventures of a Maverick Reporter.'' 
   Alice was born in Goldfield, NV, where her father was a judge and her mother was one of the first women lawyers in the State. Her family moved to Redondo Beach, CA when she was still young. After graduating from high school, Redondo Beach is where Alice began her long and passionate career as a journalist. 
   Alice worked for the Los Angeles Express when she interviewed First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Out enjoying a bicycle ride wearing shorts and a sweatshirt, Alice spotted Mrs. Roosevelt entering a beachfront hotel and ran after her to request an interview. She was granted the interview, which shocked and amazed her editors. 
   After her stint at the Los Angeles Express, Alice left journalism to attend college and law school at the University of Southern California. Financial problems during the Depression led her to leave law school early, and she took  a job as a social worker with the Emergency Relief Administration. She left this job when she married career military man, Peter Yarish, and moved with him to Hamilton Air Force Base in Novato. 
   Alice raised four children and returned to journalism when she was 42 years old. She wrote for the Marin Independent Journal, the Novato Advance, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat and the San Francisco Examiner. But it was at the Pacific Sun where she really made a name for herself as a unique, outspoken woman journalist. 
   Those who knew Alice viewed her as a sharp and witty reporter with a tremendous sense of curiosity. She took pride in uncovering injustice at every level of government. She stood out as a passionate watchdog with an incredible capacity for building friendships throughout the local community. Alice was deeply-respected by fellow journalists, editors and elected officials. She will be deeply missed. 
   Alice is survived by her four children, Tim Yarish of Sausalito, Thomas Yarish of Mill Valley, Anthony Yarish of Cotati, and Robin Ell of Portland, OR. She is also survived by seven grandchildren and three great grandchildren.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 100th anniversary of the city of Coalinga, one of the few California cities that was founded as a mining boomtown and survived. 
   The city originally known as ``Coaling'' was a sleepy coal mining town until oil was prospected in the region as early as 1865 by Southerners displaced by the Civil War. However, aside from being used to control dust on the roads and as a pitch for roofing, there was limited use for petroleum in those days. Limited uses, coupled with transportation challenges, caused early interest in oil to die down considerably. In 1891, the Southern Pacific Railroad purchased the 160-acre Melville Curtiss homestead and laid out the town site that became Coalinga. Local folklore attributes the desire for better musical effect for the addition of the final ``a'' and the eventual adoption of the town name, Coalinga. By the time the city was incorporated on April 3, 1906, the interest in oil had risen again. 
   In 1909, the Silver Tip well broke loose in the greatest gusher recorded in California at that time; spraying 36,000 barrels of oil in a 72-hour period. The emergence of Coalinga as an oil boomtown caused enough excitement that the Los Angeles Stock Exchange was shut down for a day so that the financiers of California could go witness and experience the boom for themselves. At its peak, the Silver Tip well produced 10,000 barrels of oil a day. 
   Coalinga's thriving oil fields of that time were to produce personalities and companies that were to become the giants of the industry. R.C. Baker, the founder of Baker Oil Tools, first honed his trade in Coalinga. Republic Oil Field Supply can also trace its beginnings to the city. The formula for world famous A&W root beer was first concocted in downtown Coalinga. Perhaps most famously, Coalinga's oilfield workers fought and won the industry's first 8-hour workday. 
   On May 2, 1983, a 6.7 magnitude earthquake altered the face of Coalinga. All the brick buildings constructed during the 1900s boom toppled or they had to be demolished. A large slice of the character and charm of Old Coalinga was lost. However, the town's residents demonstrated remarkable unity and determination in putting forth the hard work to make sure that Coalinga continues to grow in spite of the earthquake. Today, the former boomtown with the old brick buildings that was left reeling after the 1983 earthquake is a thriving city that is primed for even greater residential and business growth in the future. 
   For the past century, the city of Coalinga has served as a testament to the importance of community, optimism, and cooperation. As the residents of Coalinga work together with great pride to make their city a better place to call home, I congratulate them on their centennial anniversary and wish them another 100 years of good fortune and success.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the outstanding accomplishment of one of my constituents, Samuel Nassie of Paradise, CA. I am so proud to announce that in May 2005, Samuel was named the American Legion's national ``2005 Eagle Scout of the Year.'' 
   The title of Eagle Scout represents the highest rank a Boy Scout can achieve. It takes years of hard work, dedication, leadership and community service to earn this honor that only 4 percent of all Boy Scouts achieve. Therefore, to be selected as the American Legion's Eagle Scout of the Year from hundreds other highly qualified Eagle Scouts across the Nation is an extraordinary achievement and I am very proud of Samuel for his accomplishments that led to this meritorious honor. 
   Samuel's list of awards and accomplishments are too numerous to list today, but I would like to share with you some of his work that proves Samuel's dedication to his community is second to none. He was the first Boy Scout in Northern California to receive the William T. Hornaday Award, the oldest conservation award in the history of this country, with only 1,000 recipients in its 94-year history. Because of his service to the community, Samuel earned the Medal of Merit Award and the Congressional Youth Award in Bronze, Silver, and Gold. At the age of 13, Samuel achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. He was chosen as Eagle Scout of the Year for both California and the United States by the Sons of the American Revolution. The Veterans of Foreign Wars also chose him as Eagle Scout of the Year for California and awarded him second place in the United States. He is a member of the Boy Scout Honor Society, and a life member of the National Eagle Scout Association. Samuel remains active in the Boy Scouts of America by teaching at Boy Scout camps and serving as a Junior Scoutmaster for his local Boy Scout troop. 
   I would like to highlight two of Samuel's community projects that are particularly noteworthy. In his first community service project, ``Veterans Honor,'' Samuel created a program to locate, identify, plot and record the location of every veteran at his local cemetery. Another community service project, ``Buckets Full of Batteries,'' created an environmental program to recycle household batteries. Four years ago, he implemented this program in two school districts and over 20 businesses in Paradise, and is now working with 4 other cities to expand his program. 
   Samuel maintains a 4.0 GPA, and plans to attend college and study American History Education and Business. Samuel has selflessly given years of his time and energy to the community. 
   Samuel Nassie brings a great deal of pride to California. He has accomplished more in his 17 years than most of us will in our entire lives. His community, State, and country are fortunate to have a citizen of his caliber. I have no doubt that his future will be a bright and fulfilling one.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Evangel Home. Evangel Home is a shelter for needy women and children located in downtown Fresno. Now in its 50th year, Evangel Homes has been instrumental in helping hundreds of women and children piece together their broken lives. 
   Evangel Home was established in 1955 by Ms. Pauline Baker Myers as a ``Home for Needy Women and Children.'' Saddened by the lack of help for women in need at local homeless shelters, Pauline Baker Myers envisioned a shelter for women designed to help them put their lives back together. Evangel Homes became one of the first shelters of its kind in the nation. 
   Evangel Home helps women through a variety of programs. Women enter Evangel Home through Crisis Home, an emergency shelter where women may stay for up to 28 days. At Crisis Home, up to 24 women and children can receive services such as meals, shelter, clothing, and counseling. 
   Following the initial stay at Crisis Home, women may be eligible for the CrossRoads Residential Program. Through the CrossRoads Residential Program, Evangel Homes offers a 9-month program of courses and services to help women make better choices for themselves and their families. The courses are intended to help residents develop their life skills for parenting, finances and setting boundaries. 
   The GARDEN Residential Recovery Program, or God Answers, Redeems, and Delivers Everyone who draws Near to Him, is an alternative sentencing program. It is designed to rehabilitate women in a structured environment as an alternative to serving a jail or prison term. The GARDEN program accommodates as many as six women and includes courses and counseling programs tailored to teach women responsibility and decision making skills. 
   Lastly, the Community Connection Graduate Program involves graduates from the CrossRoads and GARDEN programs. Community Connection encourages women to work and attend school while providing them with a support network to ensure their success. 
   The success of Evangel Homes is evident in the many women and children who have walked out of its doors to productive and successful lives. Annually, Evangel Homes gives shelter to more than 300 women and 200 children. The mission of Evangel Homes goes far beyond giving material support to women in need. Instead, Evangel Homes gives women nurturing support in a structured environment so that they may be taught self-reliance and responsibility. 
   Evangel Homes recognizes that those who seek its help have the ability to make their own choices. Through spiritual guidance and counseling, Evangel Homes strives to erase the effect of what it calls ``disaffiliation'' or the feeling of isolation and disassociation from anything positive in their lives that many women and children feel as an effect of their disordered lives. Through programs designed to give women and children the structure, the hope, and the tools for rebuilding their lives, Evangel Homes gives women and children a ``chance for change.'' 
   I congratulate Evangel Homes on their 50th anniversary and wish them much continued success.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to honor an extraordinary actor, entertainer, and humanitarian. Upon his passing, Eddie Albert leaves a legacy of talent, determination, and good will. 
   Eddie Albert Heimberger was born in Illinois on April 22, 1906, and moved to Minneapolis as a child. It was there  that Mr. Albert began his stage career, hosting magic shows and singing in small venues to put himself through drama school. After becoming a crowd pleaser in Minnesota, he decided to pursue his creative passion in other cities and on the radio. After dropping his last name to avoid being mistakenly called Eddie Hamburger, he shifted his focus to comedy. His success on the airwaves led to his 1935 Broadway debut in the comedy ``O Evening Star.'' 
   Mr. Albert went on to appear on Broadway several times before making it to Hollywood in 1937 as Bing Edwards in the film ``Brother Rat.'' His fame grew, and in 1939 Mr. Albert started entertaining audiences as an aerialist and clown in a traveling Mexican circus. During his time there, he began providing intelligence to the U.S. Government on Japanese and Nazi activity in Mexico. His career was put on hold when he bravely served in the Marines during World War II. He was awarded the Bronze Star for his courageous fighting in the Battle of Tarawa. 
   Upon returning from his service overseas, he started Eddie Albert Productions and worked behind the camera to make sex education films, a rarity in their time. One of his best known roles was in the 1960s sitcom ``Green Acres,'' in which he portrayed lawyer turned farmer Oliver Wendell Douglas. Appearing in nearly 100 films, Mr. Albert earned two best supporting actor Academy Award nominations for his parts in ``Roman Holiday'' (1953) and ``The Heartbreak Kid'' (1972). 
   Throughout his lifetime, Mr. Albert traveled the world and became interested in the fight against poverty and preserving the environment. In the 1970s, he established the City Children's Farms and dedicated his free time to publicly speaking about the importance of nutrition for the world's children. He served as a special envoy for the philanthropic mission ``Meals for Millions'' and as a consultant for the World Hunger Conference. An avid outdoors man, Mr. Albert treasured the beaches, trails, and wildlife near his home in Southern California. He used his fame to bring much needed attention to the harmful effects of DDT and, on his birthday in 1970, Mr. Albert helped inaugurate the first Earth Day. Later that year, he and his wife opened a community arts center in Los Angeles, which is still in operation today. 
   In 1945, Mr. Albert married actress Margo, nee Maria Marguerita Guadalupe Teresa Estela Bolado Castilla y O'Donnell. She preceded him in death in 1985. Eddie Albert died of pneumonia on May 26, 2005, at his home in Pacific Palisades, CA. He is survived by his son, daughter, and two grandchildren. Whether as an entertainer or philanthropist, Mr. Albert will be remembered for his passion and dedication to making others smile. His talents and kindness will surely be missed.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to honor the 25th Anniversary of one of my State's great natural treasures, the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. 
   The Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary was designated in 1981 and was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter the day before he left office. I served on the Marin County Board of Supervisors at the time, and I remember how hard the community worked to establish this designation. 
   The year this sanctuary was established was a critical time in our country's debate about offshore oil drilling. 
   Californians overwhelmingly rejected the idea of ocean drilling and the creation of a national marine sanctuary near the Farallones Islands was seen as an important way of advancing ocean conservation. 
   The Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary encompasses 1,200 square miles of one of the richest marine ecosystems in the world. This sanctuary includes vital feeding and spawning grounds for one of the world's largest populations of the Great White Shark, a large variety of fish and shellfish, and over 36 marine mammals, including the endangered Humpback and Blue whales. The sanctuary also includes the Farallon Islands--the largest seabird nesting area in the contiguous United States. 
   In our efforts to protect ocean life and the marine environment, the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary plays a crucial role. Scientists from all over the world come to study this dynamic ecosystem. 
   Yet offshore oil drilling and exploration continue to threaten this sanctuary and the California coast. Earlier this year, I introduced the California Ocean and Coastal Protection Act with Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN and Congresswoman LOIS CAPPS. This bill would provide permanent protection for California's coast from future offshore oil drilling. 
   Last year, Congresswoman LYNN WOOLSEY and I introduced legislation to expand the boundaries of the Gulf of the Farallones sanctuary and its neighboring Cordell Bank sanctuary, to protect the entire coast of Sonoma County from future oil and gas exploration. Californians have been demanding this type of protection for a generation. 
   The California coast is enjoyed by Californians and visitors from around the world, and the natural resources of the Pacific Ocean are priceless and vital to a healthy, growing California economy. My goal has always been permanent protection for the California coast, and I will continue fighting for this protection as long as I am in the United States Senate. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to protect the ocean, one of our greatest natural resources. The National Marine Sanctuary Program, established in 1972, plays a critical role in preserving our precious marine resources and protecting our coasts from offshore oil and gas development. 
   I applaud everyone who has worked to protect the marine ecosystem of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. I wish sanctuary staff and volunteers many years of ongoing success in protecting the California coastal environment. Please join me in celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize the centennial anniversary of San Francisco's historic Japantown. Today San Francisco's Japantown is one of only three remaining Japantowns in California. The other two are in Los Angeles and San Jose. For the past 100 years, Japantown has been an integral part of San Francisco's rich and diverse cultural history. At 100 years old, it is the first and oldest Japantown in the continental United States. 
   The first Japanese immigrants arrived in San Francisco in the 1860s. Originally settling in the South Park and Chinatown areas, the Japanese community relocated to the Western Addition after the great earthquake and fire of 1906 destroyed much of San Francisco. When Japantown relocated to the Western Addition in 1906, the Japanese community had the opportunity to grow. More Japanese businesses, shops, churches, schools, restaurants, and hotels moved to the area and supported community development. Before long, the area became known as Nihonmachi, or Japantown. At the height of its growth in 1940, more than 5,000 Japanese lived in Japantown, and there were more than 200 Japanese-owned businesses. 
   We are not proud of what happened to the Japanese-American community during World War II in the early 1940s. In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which forced ``all persons of Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens'' into internment camps until the end of World War II. The internment was fueled by racism and war hysteria and will forever tarnish our country's history. As time has proved, there was no excuse for our Government's decision to intern American citizens. Since those dark days, our Nation has made great strides toward tolerance and inclusion. 
   In 1983, as part of Fred Korematsu's successful petition to the Federal District Court in San Francisco to overturn his conviction for violating evacuation orders, the court also ruled that the internment of American citizens of Japanese descent during World War II was legally unsupportable. In 1989, Congress passed legislation formally apologizing for the internment of Japanese-American citizens during World War II and authorized a reparations fund for internment survivors. Though we still have further to go to assure equality for all, most Americans now realize that diversity is one of our country's greatest strengths. 
   When the Japanese community returned to San Francisco after World War II, it was difficult to rebuild the extensive community that existed before the war. However, despite the many barriers, the Japanese community did rebuild Japantown. And although San Francisco's Japantown is smaller today than it was in the past, it still plays a large and important role in our community. Not only does it serve as a reminder of our past, it provides us with an opportunity to celebrate the history, challenges, triumphs, and contributions of the Japanese-American community in San Francisco. 
   For 100 years, San Francisco's Japantown has served as a cultural resource for the San Francisco Bay area and California. I thank the San Francisco Japantown community for its many efforts to educate the community about Japanese culture and traditions. I congratulate them on their centennial anniversary and wish them another 100 years of success.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for designating September as Leukemia and Lymphoma Awareness Month. It is estimated that leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma will kill 60,500 people in the United States this year and that 110,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. With more than 700,000 Americans living with blood cancers, it is crucial that we come together to reinvigorate our resolve and continuously intensify our fight for a cure. 
   I am pleased to join the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society in encouraging all to put aside time to reflect on what has been achieved so far in fighting blood cancers, spread lifesaving knowledge, and set our sights on progressive goals to advance our ability to support and treat those living with leukemia and lymphoma. Together, we can push forward critical research and keep the eradication of these diseases at the forefront of dialogue and education in our local and national communities. 
   I applaud the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society for its support of treatment and research. Such work is integral to our ability to understand these illnesses and energize our fellow citizens in this very worthy endeavor. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society has provided an outstanding model of advocacy and paved the way for others to get involved. 
   I am pleased to invite my colleagues to join me in acknowledging Leukemia and Lymphoma Awareness Month. I hope that you will use this time as inspiration for continued thoughtful leadership on this critical health issue.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor the life of Dave Tatsuno, whose courageous documentation of life in a Japanese-American internment camp contributed immensely to our knowledge of this dark time in U.S. history. Mr. Tatsuno passed away on January 26, 2006. He was 92. 
   Mr. Tatsuno, born in 1913 to a family who had come to the United States in the late 19th century, was raised in San Francisco, in my home State of California. Mr. Tatsuno changed his first name from Masaharu to Dave when he successfully ran for student body president of his junior high school; Masaharu was too long to fit on his campaign posters. In 1936, Mr. Tatsuno graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in business and went to work at Nichi Bei Bussan, a department store in San Francisco that his father founded. 
   After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which forced ``all persons of Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens'' into internment camps until the end of World War II. Mr. Tatsuno and his family were forced to move to the Topaz Relocation Center, an internment camp in Topaz, AZ. Over the next 3 years, Mr. Tatsuno secretly filmed life in the camp with an 8-millimeter Bell & Howell camera that Walter Honderick, his supervisor at the internment camp's co-op store, helped smuggle in. Because the camera was forbidden, Mr. Tatsuno kept it hidden in a shoe box, taking it out only when guards were not looking. These images of daily life in Topaz--of church services, of people gardening, of birthday celebrations--have left viewers with a stark image of what life was like during those hard years. 
   After the Tatsuno family was released from the internment camp, Mr. Tatsuno's footage of life in Topaz was turned into a 48-minute silent film, ``Topaz.'' In 1996, the Library of Congress placed ``Topaz'' on its National Film Registry, which was established in 1989 by Congress to preserve culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant films. Mr. Tatsuno's film is one of only two home movies on the registry's 425-film list; the other film is Abraham Zapruder's footage of the John F. Kennedy assassination. The original footage for ``Topaz'' is now a part of the permanent collection at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. 
   After the war, Mr. Tatsuno helped his father reopen Nichi Bei Bussan and took over the business when his father retired. Through this work, Mr. Tatsuno became a prominent and respected businessman and civic leader in San Francisco and San Jose, where he eventually made his home. He also remained engaged and interested in film. His compassion and thoughtfulness inspired many others and he will be deeply missed. 
   Mr. Tatsuno is survived by three daughters, Arlene Damron, Valerie Sermon, and Melanie Cochran; two sons, Rod Tatsuno and Sheridan Tatsuno; his sister, Chiye Watanabe; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family. 
   Dave Tatsuno played down the importance of his role in chronicling the history of the Japanese-American internment camps, always giving credit to Walter Honderick. But Dave Tatsuno will long be remembered for his courage and perseverance in difficult times. His film will have a lasting effect on many generations to come.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last Tuesday the open enrollment period for the Medicare Part D prescription drug program began. This program has been praised by the administration as a great benefit for seniors, but I can tell you that seniors are not so sure. According to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 20 percent say they will sign up. Over one-third say they won't, and the rest don't know what they are going to do. 
   One thing we do know for sure is that seniors are confused and scared. I have received over 4,000 letters from them telling me so. And why wouldn't they be. They have a series of complicated decisions to make. 
   First, they have to decide whether they want drug coverage. Do they already have drug coverage that is better or just as good as what is offered under the plan? And if they don't, do the costs of the plan exceed the benefits? And what will happen in the future? Should they sign up now to avoid the penalty for signing up late? 
   Second, if they do decide to join the program, what plan do they choose? In California, 18 companies are providing 47 stand-alone prescription drug plans. These plans all have different premiums, copays, and lists of drugs they will cover. For those in managed care plans, if they choose one of the stand-alone drug plans instead of their managed care plan, they will lose their health coverage. 
   In addition, seniors must make sure that their neighborhood pharmacy accepts the plan. Otherwise, they will end up having to find a new pharmacy that is probably less convenient. And after all that, any plan can--on 60 days notice--change the list of drugs it covers. Seniors, however, can change their plans only once a year. 
   If seniors do choose to participate, the benefit itself is meager. There is a large coverage gap--the so-called donut hole--so seniors must pay 100 percent of drug costs once they spend $2,250 and before they spend $5,100. Moreover, there is nothing in the program that will actually lower the cost of prescription drugs, and, in fact, Medicare is expressly prohibited from negotiating for lower prices. 
   Mr. President, the seniors who are the sickest and poorest have the most to lose with this new program. Those 6.1 million seniors are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. They are known as dual eligibles. Currently, State Medicaid programs cover their drug costs, but as of January 1, they will be switched to the less generous Medicare program, and the States will be prohibited from using Medicaid to provide better coverage. 
   We need to make changes to the program now so that our seniors do not suffer. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of several bills that will change the harshest parts of this program. We must allow Medicare to negotiate on behalf of seniors for lower drug prices. We must allow States to use Medicaid to improve the drug coverage of the sickest and poorest seniors. We must end the coverage gap for all seniors. We must allow seniors more time to understand the program before they are required to enroll. 
   Mr. President, these changes are needed--and needed now. Without them, the promise of a Medicare prescription drug benefit may turn out to be a hollow one.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to recognize the 60th anniversary of the United Nations. 
   In 1945, as World War II was ending, representatives of 50 countries met in San Francisco, CA at the United Nations Conference on International Organization to draft the Charter of the United Nations. On October 24, 1945, the Charter achieved the required number of signatories for ratification, and the United Nations officially came into existence. Today, 60 years later, I am proud to reflect on the United Nation's many successes. I would also like to use this occasion to highlight the vital importance of building an even stronger United Nations for the future. 
   The United Nations was established with the primary purpose of providing a forum for the nations of the world to resolve issues without resorting to war. It has achieved many successes on this front, the greatest of which is that we have not had a world war since the United Nations was founded. For those regions of the world that have endured conflict, the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operation has facilitated more than 67 peacekeeping operations and is credited with negotiating more than 170 peaceful settlements that have ended regional conflicts. 
   Through the World Health Organization, the U.N. has combated the spread of pandemic diseases and continues to provide lifesaving drugs and medical care to millions of people around the world. Another U.N. program, the World Food Program, has served as a lifeline to millions of people who would otherwise face famine. And the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has helped raise the female literacy rate in many developing countries around the world. I commend the United Nations for these outstanding achievements and the countless others it has made during the last 60 years. 
   But despite these many successes, there is still a long way to go. First and foremost, the United Nations must be reformed from within. In recent months, there have been far too many troubling incidents involving the United Nations, ranging from the Iraqi oil-for-food scandal, and the tragic sexual abuse cases involving peacekeeping troops in the Congo and elsewhere--and rightfully so; these acts were most egregious. These types of activities cannot continue if the United Nations is to receive the support and legitimacy it needs to tackle the challenges of the 21st century. 
   If the United Nations is comprehensively reformed from within, then it will find itself in an even better position to meet its larger goals. According to the United Nations' own figures, nearly a quarter of the children in the developed world are malnourished, and in a number of places in the world, the poor are actually getting poorer. I am pleased that the United Nations has embraced these challenges through the establishment of the Millennium Development Goals, which range from eradicating extreme poverty and hunger to combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. But there is much work to be done if these goals are to become reality. The international community must commit to working together. The only way to achieve real progress on these fronts will require consensus, partnership, and unity of effort on the part of all nations of the world. For this reason, a strong United Nations is more important than ever. 
   I congratulate the United Nations on its 60th anniversary and look forward to doing my part to ensure its continued success in the future.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor the life of Sam Chu Lin, who broke new ground as one of the first Asian American journalists. Mr. Chu Lin passed away on March 5, 2006, at the age of 67. 
   Mr. Chu Lin was born and raised in Mississippi. He had a lifelong interest in news and journalism. When he was a teenager, Mr. Chu Lin would listen to the radio at night, emulating the voices of the top broadcasters. His practice paid off in 1956, when he convinced his hometown radio station in Greenville, MS, that he could find sponsors and host a show of his own. Mr. Chu Lin later attended Michigan State University, where he received degrees in journalism and communications. 
   In the 1960s, Mr. Chu Lin began his career as a journalist, working as a reporter and anchor at television and radio stations, including KRON-TV in the San Francisco Bay area, and KTLA Channel 5 and KFWB radio, both in Los Angeles. In the 1970s, he became one of the first Asian-American journalists to rise from local to network news, working for CBS News in New York. While at CBS, Mr. Chu Lin reported to a national television audience the historic news that the Vietnam War was over. 
   Throughout his career, Mr. Chu Lin demonstrated his versatility as a reporter. He interviewed Presidents and world leaders, and he covered earthquakes and other natural disasters. In the late 1980s, he reported from China about the government crackdown on the Tiananmen Square demonstration for democracy. Since 1995, Mr. Chu Lin worked at KTTV Fox 11 News in Los Angeles. In addition, he wrote numerous articles about Asian-American affairs for news publications such as Asian Week, Rafu Shimpo, the Nichi Bei Times, and the San Francisco Examiner. He was also a regular contributor to KQED radio in San Francisco. 
   Over the years, Mr. Chu Lin was the recipient of many awards and accolades from prestigious organizations, including the Associated Press, United Press International, the Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Greater Los Angeles Press Club, and the Radio and Television News Association. As a strong advocate for Asian-Pacific-Americans and their contributions throughout history, Mr. Chu Lin was also the recipient of many awards from Asian-Pacific-American organizations, most recently the 2005 Spirit of America Award from the Chinese American Citizens Alliance. 
   Sam Chu Lin believed that journalism should be educational, and that ``informing and helping others is what makes journalism exciting.'' He felt that journalism was a ``chance to use your roots for a positive purpose.'' In his reports, articles, and stories, it was evident that Mr. Chu Lin did just that. He was a tireless advocate on behalf of the Asian-Pacific-American community, whether he was producing documentaries on the Asian-Pacific American experience or speaking to organizations about the importance of civic participation. His contributions to the field of journalism, especially within the Asian-Pacific-American community, will not be forgotten. 
   Mr. Chu Lin is survived by his wife, Judy; his two sons, Mark and Christopher; and his mother. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family. 
   Sam Chu Lin was a pioneer among Asian-American journalists, and he will be missed by all who knew him. We take comfort in knowing that future generations will benefit from his tenacity, his strength and his desire to make America a better place to live.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 100th anniversary of one of the most significant disasters in California history, San Francisco's Great Earthquake and Fire of 1906. 
   One hundred years ago, the city of San Francisco experienced this horrific tragedy when the city shook for almost 60 seconds and communities from as far away as Oregon, Los Angeles, and Nevada felt the tremors. The Richter scale was not yet in existence in 1906, but seismologists today estimate this earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7 to 8.0. 
   Following the earthquake, fires broke out across the city and raged for 3 days. In fact, the fires did more damage than the earthquake. As a result of this disaster, over 3,000 people were killed, 300,000 people became homeless, and the city suffered about $500 million worth of damage. Telegraph and telephone services were destroyed as well as the municipal railway and all government buildings. 
   The 100th anniversary of this historic tragedy provides an opportunity to reflect on what we have learned and how to better prepare for a similar event. We now know that residents must be prepared to be self-sufficient for 72 hours following a disaster. And the city of San Francisco has done a great deal to make the community safer. 
   San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom has spearheaded an updated citywide emergency plan--the first time it has been done in 10 years. The San Francisco Fire Department offers training in disaster and emergency response for residents. Over 11,000 San Francisco residents have completed the course in the past 15 years. San Francisco has also invested $2.5 million in leading the development of a regional response plan with seven other bay area counties. This is one of the first regional response plans in the country. I commend the city and county of San Francisco on its efforts to ensure the city is ready to respond to a disaster. 
   Having witnessed the slow response to Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf States, I wrote to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, in September asking for a copy of their disaster response plan for a serious earthquake in California. I am still waiting to receive their plan. Without the plan in hand, I remain very concerned that FEMA is not prepared should a major earthquake or natural disaster occur in California. 
   It is very important that the State of California and its residents are working to prepare themselves for a major disaster. I have created a ``Getting Ready'' guide on my Senate Web site to help my constituents prepare their homes and families for a disaster. This guide is organized in easy-to-follow steps and provides links to other preparedness sites--www.boxer.senate.gov/equake.cfm. 
   On the 100th anniversary of the Great San Francisco Earthquake and Fire, I rise to honor the memory of those who lost their lives during this disaster. I also pause to reflect on the tragedy that befell this great city and its citizens. The community came together to repair and restore the city, and today, San Francisco is one of the United States' top tourist destinations and a dynamic urban center. 
   I also commemorate this anniversary by encouraging all of us to look forward and ensure our families are prepared for a major earthquake or similar disaster. I will continue fighting to ensure the Federal Government is taking the steps necessary to help our local communities in disaster response.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the memory of a very special man, Martin Mackey of Marin County, CA, who died on March 25, 2005. He was 87 years old. Martin Mackey was born in San Francisco. He earned his engineering degree from Stanford and entered the Navy Midshipman Reserve Training Program. He served in the Navy during World War II and was trained in antisubmarine warfare. 
   Martin met his wife Mary while on leave in Seattle during World War II. They were engaged 5 days later. Martin and Mary just celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary last December. 
   After the war and after 22 years of steel and concrete sales with a multinational company, Martin retired with a desire to change the world. The year was 1968, and he was deeply disturbed by social injustice and the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert Kennedy. He went on a weekend retreat with his wife Mary to figure out what he should contribute to make our world a better place. 
   Martin played a key role in bringing affordable housing to Marin County. President Lyndon Johnson had just signed the Housing Act into law. Martin's good friend, Larry Livingston, who was a city and regional planner, told Martin that Marin County badly needed low and moderate-income housing. Martin was convinced. As chairman of the Social Concerns Committee at Marin County Unitarian Church, he called upon ministers throughout the county to form a social action group to respond to the community's housing needs. They met in a rent-free office in the attic of a convent. Then he called upon other leaders and friends in the community to join their efforts. This social action group of faith and community leaders began to raise money and became the Ecumenical Association for Housing, EAH, still in existence today. 
   EAH began with 24 organizations, each pledging $200. Martin selflessly accepted a salary of $1 to serve as executive director. EAH quickly took off and began lending money to architects and regional groups to build affordable housing projects throughout Marin. Their first project was Pilgrim Park, a 61 unit, low-income housing development in San Rafael. 
   For more than 22 years, Martin devoted himself to EAH and affordable housing. Martin worked to persuade citizens and elected officials to accept low and moderate-income housing in their wealthy communities. To develop his knowledge and save EAH outside consultant fees, Martin went to Catholic University in Washington, DC, to take a 2-month course in how to be a housing consultant. He eventually expanded his services and consulted for affordable housing projects in other parts of the Bay Area as well as Arizona. 
   From its origins as the fledgling group Martin founded in 1968 to a 325-person staff and $6 million budget, EAH has completed 62 projects and 4,556 housing units in the Bay area and beyond. 
   Martin was a dynamic figure in Marin County. My staff and I always knew we could call on him for invaluable information and sound advice. He was a passionate and effective advocate for affordable housing. He led EAH with a sense of humor and a deep appreciation for the dedicated individuals who worked with him. His accomplishments in creating affordable housing for Marin residents is legendary. He was also a respected member of the Marin community and a wonderful, inspiring man who will be deeply missed. We take comfort in knowing that countless future generations will benefit from his courage, his vision and his leadership.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to an extraordinary woman, renowned reproductive health expert Dr. Felicia Hance Stewart. Dr. Stewart died on April 13 at the age of 63. Her energy, compassion, intelligence and tireless commitment to  women's health made a difference for countless women in the U.S. and around the world. 
   Dr. Stewart's keen mind and affinity for medicine were apparent from her distinguished educational background. She received her bachelor of arts degree from the University of California, Berkeley, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and with honors in biochemistry. In 1969, she received her M.D. degree from Harvard University Medical School. She did her postgraduate training at Cambridge City Hospital in Massachusetts and at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. 
   Dr. Stewart's passion for empowering women through increased access to reproductive health services was evident throughout her extraordinary career. Dr. Stewart began her practice in obstetrics and gynecology in Sacramento, working for Sutter Medical Group, doing clinical research with a focus on contraceptives. She also worked as associate medical director of Planned Parenthood in Sacramento. 
   In 1994, Dr. Stewart was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs in the Clinton administration's Department of Health and Human Services, HHS. Working with then-Secretary of HHS Donna Shalala, Dr. Stewart was the senior expert responsible for family planning. 
   In 1996, she became director of Reproductive Health Programs at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park, CA. She was most recently codirector of the Bixby Center for Reproductive Health Research and Policy at UCSF. 
   Dr. Stewart wrote ``Understanding Your Body: Everywoman's Guide to a Lifetime of Health,'' 1987, and ``My Body, My Health: The Concerned Woman's Guide to Gynecology and Health,'' 1979. She cowrote ``Contraceptive Technology,'' a major professional reference book that has been published in 18 editions, and ``Emergency Contraception: The Nation's Best Kept Secret.'' She also published nearly 100 scientific journal articles. 
   Dr. Stewart's passionate and reasoned advocacy for increasing access to emergency contraception brought national attention to this critical women's health issue. Dr. Stewart was instrumental in conducting research which established that emergency contraception was safe and effective without a physician's prescription. Her research has helped increase access to emergency contraception in pharmacies throughout California. 
   In 1973, after Roe v. Wade was handed down, none of us thought we still would be fighting the same battle to protect fundamental women's reproductive rights in 2006. But the fight is more challenging than ever. Not only are we fighting to maintain abortion rights, but access to comprehensive health services, including contraception. 
   Dr. Felicia Stewart was at the forefront of that fight throughout her career. Her work helped prevent countless unintended pregnancies and empowered women to take control of their reproductive health. Dr. Stewart impacted many lives, from the women and men she served in clinics to the doctors, researchers and activists she inspired to follow in her footsteps. She leaves us with the inspiration to work harder and never give up the fight to secure the full range of reproductive health services for women. She leaves a lasting legacy that will not be forgotten. 
   Dr. Stewart is survived by her son Matthew Stewart and daughter Kathryn Stewart; her parents Lena and Harold Hance; her brother Allan Hance; stepchildren Tammy Barlow, Wayne Stewart, and Michael Stewart. 
   I am proud to have stood with Dr. Felicia Stewart in our fight to increase access to women's reproductive health services. She was a wonderful ally and supporter of my work in the Senate. She will be greatly missed.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor the life of Delbert Wong, the first Chinese-American judge in the continental United States. Judge Wong passed away on March 10, 2006, at the age of 85. 
   Delbert Wong was born in Hanford, CA, on May 17, 1920, and was raised a short distance away in Bakersfield. After obtaining an associate of arts degree from Bakersfield College, he transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where he received an undergraduate degree in business. 
   After he left U.C. Berkeley, Delbert joined the Army Air Corps during World War II and became one of 18 B-17 Flying Fortress navigators that graduated in his class at Mather Field in Sacramento. During his service with the military, he was 1 of only 3 navigators who completed their 30 bombing missions. For his bravery and dedication, 1LT Delbert Wong was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, as well as four Air Medals, for his wartime service. 
   Following the war, Delbert was faced with a tough choice: should he join his family's grocery business or enter law school? He chose law school, and in 1949 became the first Chinese American graduate of Stanford University's School of Law. After his graduation, Delbert continued to break new ground. He was the first Asian American to be appointed Deputy Legislative Counsel serving the California State Legislature, and the first Asian American to be appointed a deputy state attorney general. 
   During his tenure as a deputy State attorney general, Delbert was appointed by then-Governor Pat Brown to the Los Angeles County Municipal Court bench in 1959, making him the first Chinese American named to the bench in the continental United States. Two years later, Judge Wong was elevated to the superior court, where he served for over 20 years. 
   Throughout his career, Judge Wong was an exemplary jurist who dedicated his life to public service. Even after he retired from the bench in 1986, he continued to be deeply involved in his community. 
   Among his many accomplishments, Judge Wong researched and reported on racial issues within the Los Angeles Airport Police Bureau at the request of the Los Angeles Department of Airports; was appointed by then-mayor of Los Angeles Tom Bradley to serve on a panel tasked with drafting an ethics policy for the city of Los Angeles; and was appointed chair of the Asian Pacific American Focus Program of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, to combat the rise in violence against Asian Americans. 
   Together with his wife Dolores, Judge Wong was also an ardent supporter of the Chinese American community, making significant contributions to the Asian Pacific American Legal Center, the Chinatown Service Center, and the Asian Pacific American Friends of the Center Theater Group. 
   Judge Wong was a trailblazer for Asian Americans in the field of law. His dedication to justice and equality was evident in everything that he did. His many years of service--for the city of Los Angeles, for the State of California and for the Nation will not be forgotten. 
   Judge Wong is survived by his wife Dolores; his children Kent, Shelley, Duane, and Marshall; and his three grandchildren. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family. 
   Whether he was fighting for our country or fighting for integrity and equality under the law, Judge Delbert Wong was undeterred in his efforts to make America a better place to live. He will be missed by all who knew him. We take comfort in knowing that future generations will benefit from his passion and dedication to justice.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize a wonderful Californian, Alan Bergman, in honor of his 80th birthday. Few in the world today have brought so much pleasure, joy, and insight to so many as have Alan and his wife Marilyn. 
   Alan Bergman was born on September 11, 1925, in Brooklyn, NY. He had an ear for music at a young age--at age 10, he knew he wanted to be a songwriter. After studying at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California at Los Angeles, Alan moved to Philadelphia. There, he worked as a director for children's television shows, and moonlighted as a songwriter. He soon moved back to Los Angeles at the urging of his mentor, Johnny Mercer, to work full time on his budding songwriting career. 
   In Los Angeles, Alan met Marilyn Keith. Alan and Marilyn hit it off right away, and Alan knew that in Marilyn he had a friend and a musical partner. Alan also knew that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with this remarkable woman. And in 1958, Alan and Marilyn were married. With Marilyn's musical background, she and Alan were a perfect match. They began to write lyrics together. It soon became evident that Alan and Marilyn Bergman were a powerful team, working on lyrics for television shows and movies. In 1968, their efforts won them their first Oscar for ``The Windmills of Your Mind,'' the theme song from the ``Thomas Crown Affair.'' 
   There would be more recognition to come for the Bergmans, the only husband-and-wife team of lyricists. In 1968, Alan and Marilyn also won a Golden Globe Award for ``The Windmills of Your Mind.'' In 1973, Alan and Marilyn won two Emmys, an Oscar, a Grammy, and a Golden Globe Award for ``The Way We Were.'' In 1984, they won another Oscar for the score for ``Yentl,'' and won Emmys for ``Sybil,'' ``Queen of the Stardust Ballroom,'' ``Ordinary Miracles'' and ``A Ticket to Dream.'' And these are just a few of Alan and Marilyn's many awards. 
   In addition to these awards, Alan and Marilyn have received many accolades. Among others, they have been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and have received the National Academy of Songwriters Lifetime Achievement Award, the Spanish Cultural Medal of Honor, and the Governors Award from the National Association of Recording Arts and Sciences. As president of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, Marilyn has worked with many in Congress, in a bipartisan way, to protect intellectual property rights. 
   Recently, Alan unveiled another one of his many talents--in addition to being a world-renowned songwriter, Alan is also a gifted singer. He has performed shows across the country, from the Algonquin Hotel in New York to the Jazz Bakery in Los Angeles, showcasing the songs that he has written with Marilyn. 
   When I met Alan and Marilyn in 1990, I knew that my life as a political leader would take on a new dimension. I was to learn that as a human being I had been enriched beyond measure. 
   Alan and Marilyn's musical achievements throughout their lifetimes show how exceedingly talented and gifted they are. Their success is a result of their hard work and dedication. It is no wonder that they are one of the most respected songwriting teams in music today. 
   I believe it is appropriate that Alan be recognized in the Congressional Record today not only on the occasion of his 80th birthday, but, along with Marilyn, for enriching the lives of so many Americans for so many years.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened to inform you of the passing of Miguel Contreras, secretary-treasurer for the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO. I would like to take a few moments to recognize the many important accomplishments of Miguel Contreras and the tremendous impact he made on the labor movement. 
   Miguel led the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor for nearly a decade. During his tenure, he continuously fought for the rights of laborers, and did so with great success. Through his guidance and leadership, The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor entered a period of unprecedented advancement and success. 
   Miguel Contreras was a man with humble beginnings. The son of farm workers, he began working in the fields of California's Central Valley at a very young age. With his early exposure to the difficult life of a farm worker, he quickly joined the ranks of political activists in labor as a volunteer with the United Farm Workers of America. He stood with Cesar Chavez and the UFW during their national grape boycott, and continued the fight for workers for the remaining years of his life. 
   In 1996, Miguel Contreras became the first Latino to win the post of secretary-treasurer for the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO--comprising 350 local unions and more than 800,000 members. Under his leadership, The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor had seen phenomenal growth. He coordinated many successful labor rights victories including the labor dispute of 2000 when 8,500 janitors from Service Employees International Union, SEIU, Local 1877 fought for and won a higher standard of living and better working conditions. 
   Fighting for the rights of laborers was at the core of Miguel Contreras' beliefs, an attribute which made him a great leader for laborers throughout the State of California. He cared about regular people and timelessly worked for their welfare. 
   I invite all of my colleagues to join me and the many mourning members of the labor community in recognizing and honoring Miguel Contreras for his guidance and life-long effort in fighting to improve the lives of laborers. He is survived by his wife Maria Elena Durazo and two sons, Michael and Mario.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in enthusiastic support of the confirmation of Judge Stephen Larson to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, one of the Nation's busiest Federal courts, serving seven of Southern California's most populous counties. 
   Judge Larson is a model of hard work, fairness, moderation and judicial independence. Judge Larson is skilled at bringing all sides together. He is a Republican with broad local, bipartisan support and respect from lawyers, judges and Federal practitioners in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, where he currently serves. 
   Judge Larson has had a distinguished legal career and a sterling reputation within the California legal community. He was sworn in as magistrate on September 25, 2000. Prior to this position, Judge Larson was a Federal prosecutor and chief of the Organized Crime Section of the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
   Judge Larson is a nationally known expert in organized and international crime. He was heavily involved in fighting Russian gangs and helped form the Russian Organized Crime Program in Los Angeles. 
   Judge Larson earned his undergraduate degree from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. While at Georgetown, he served as a teaching assistant to former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. He earned his law degree from the University of Southern California in 1989. He worked as an associate at O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles until 1991, when he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
   I congratulate Judge Larson on his confirmation vote. And I look forward to what I hope will be many years of service to the people of California and the Nation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues the memory of one of the world's heroes, Mr. Simon Wiesenthal, who died on September 20, 2005, at the age of 96. 
   Simon Wiesenthal was a Holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to honoring its victims by bringing its perpetrators to justice. By fighting against intolerance and genocide everywhere, he worked tirelessly to see that ``never forget'' would someday mean ``never again.'' 
   We in California have a special bond with Simon Wiesenthal because the Simon Wiesenthal Center is based in Los Angeles. Founded in 1977, the Wiesenthal Center preserves the memory of the Holocaust and continues the work of Simon Wiesenthal by fostering tolerance and understanding through community involvement, educational outreach, and social action. Today, the center also includes the world-renowned Museum of Tolerance. 
   Simon Wiesenthal was born on December 31, 1908, in western Ukraine. He received his degree in architectural engineering from the Technical University of Prague in 1932. After graduation, he worked as an architect in Lvov, Poland. In 1936, he married his high school sweetheart, Cyla Mueller. 
   Three years later, Germany and Russia signed their nonaggression pact and partitioned Poland. As a result, the Soviet Army occupied Lvov and began purging Jewish professionals. Simon was forced to close his business and work in a bedspring factory. Many of his family members were imprisoned or killed. Simon tried to save his family from deportation by bribing the Soviet Secret Police. However, he and his wife were sent to the Janwska concentration camp and then to a forced labor camp for the Eastern Railroad. By 1942, nearly 90 members of his and his wife's family perished. 
   Simon was able to help his wife Cyla escape through the Polish underground on false papers. However, after escaping the forced labor camp in 1943, Simon was captured and sent back to Janwska. When the Soviet Army advanced on the German eastern front, he was forced to join SS guards on a march westward. The march ended in the Mauthausen concentration camp. Simon narrowly survived when Mauthausen was liberated by the Americans on May 5, 1945. At 6 feet tall, he weighed 100 pounds. 
   In late 1945, Simon and his wife were reunited. Both had believed the other to be dead. In 1946, their daughter Paulinka was born. 
   Simon spent the rest of his life tracking down Nazis and working to bring them to justice. He said that in various ways he helped bring 1,100 former Nazis to trial. Of these were Adolf Eichmann, who supervised implementation of the ``Final Solution,'' Karl Silberbauer, the Gestapo officer who arrested Anne Frank, and Hermie Braunsteiner Ryan, who supervised the killing of hundreds of children at a Polish camp. 
   Mr. Wiesenthal prepared evidence on Nazi atrocities for the war crimes section of the U.S. Army. He headed the relief and welfare organization, Jewish Central Committee of the United States Zone of Austria. After the Nuremberg Trials, Simon opened the Historical Documentation Center in Linz, Austria, to assemble evidence for future Nazi trials. The center was eventually relocated to Vienna and continues to gather and analyze information on German war criminals and neo-Nazi groups; thousands of former Nazis are considered still at-large throughout Germany today. 
   For his courage and commitment to justice, Mr. Wiesenthal has been honored with many awards, including: the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal presented to him in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter; the United Nations League for the Help of Refugees Award; and an honorary British knighthood. 
   Mr. Wiesenthal is survived by his daughter Paulinka Kreisberg, who lives in Israel, and three grandchildren. 
   With the passing of Simon Wiesenthal, the world has lost one of its great heroes, but we shall never lose sight of the lesson he taught us: that humanity will rise up against hate and tyranny, and those who commit crimes against humanity will be brought to justice. As Mr. Wiesenthal said in a 1964 article in the New York Times Magazine:  
    [w]hen we come to the other world and meet the millions of Jews who died in the camps and they ask us, ``What have you done?'' there will be many answers. ..... But I will say, I didn't forget you.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary woman, Dana Reeve, who died on Monday, March 6 at the age of 44. Dana's courage, grace and love in dealing with the tragic paralysis of her late husband, actor Christopher Reeve, were an inspiration to millions of Americans. Dana and Christopher's tireless advocacy on behalf of individuals and families living with spinal cord injury made them American heroes. 
   Dana Morosini was born in 1961 to Dr. Charles Morosini and Helen Morosini. She grew up in Scarsdale, New York, graduated cum laude from Middlebury College in Vermont and studied acting at the California Institute of the Arts. 
   Dana was an accomplished actress and singer. She appeared on Broadway, off Broadway and in regional theatre, on television and in HBO films, and performed as a singer on national television and in venues around New York. Reeve co-hosted ``Lifetime Live,'' a daily women's information program on the Lifetime network. 
   It was while Dana performed in a late-night cabaret at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in 1987 that she met actor Christopher Reeve, who was in the audience. They married on April 11, 1992. Their son Will was born in 1992. She was also stepmother to Christopher's children Matthew and Alexandra Exton Reeve. She was a devoted and loving mother, deeply committed to her family. 
   In 1995, America watched in disbelief as an equestrian accident left Christopher Reeve, perhaps best known for his film role as Superman, paralyzed. America was inspired as Dana Reeve courageously and publicly supported Christopher with humor and grace. Dana and Christopher helped propel spinal cord injury into the national spotlight, working to increase funding and find a cure. They became actively involved in fighting for the rights of the disabled and helping families live with spinal cord injury. Our hearts went out to Dana and her family when Christopher Reeve passed away on October 10, 2004. 
   Dana was a founding board member of the Christopher Reeve Foundation, which became the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation after its merger with the American Paralysis Association. Dana took over as chair after her husband's death. Dana was deeply involved with the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Resource Center, PRC, which promotes the health and well-being of people and families living with paralysis. 
   Dana was also committed to the Reeve-Irvine Center for Spinal Cord  Research at the University of California, Irvine. The Reeve-Irvine Research Center is the premier research and education center working to find innovative new treatments for spinal cord injury. I was proud to work with Christopher and Dana to support therapeutic stem cell research, which holds the promise to treat a vast array of diseases, including juvenile diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, heart disease, and cancer as well as spinal cord injuries. 
   Dana received numerous awards in recognition of her strength, courage and positive attitude: the American Cancer Society's Mother of the Year Award in 2005; the Visiting Nurses Association's Caregiver's Courage Award; and she was named one of America's Outstanding Women of 1995 by ``CBS This Morning.'' 
   In August, 2005, America was upset to learn that Dana Reeve had lung cancer. Dana and Christopher were both nonsmokers. As always, Dana remained an inspiration. In a May 2005 interview, she said ``Now, more than ever, I feel Chris with me as I face this challenge,'' she said. ``As always, I look to him as the ultimate example of defying the odds with strength, courage, and hope in the face of life's adversities.'' She also said ``There's a formula Chris and I used all the time. When you least feel like it, do something for someone else. You forget about your own situation. It gives you a purpose, as opposed being sorrowful and lonely. It makes me feel better when things are too hard for me.'' 
   Dana and Christopher showed a deep love for each other, their family and for humanity. They will always be remembered. We must renew our efforts to find cures for spinal cord injuries and cancer and to advance stem cell research on their behalf. 
   Dana Reeve is survived by her son Will; father, Dr. Charles Morosini; sisters Deborah Morosini and Adrienne Morosini Heilman; and two stepchildren, Matthew and Alexandra Exton Reeve.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to 15 young Americans who have been killed in Iraq since December 9. This brings to 523 the number of soldiers who were either from California or based in California that have been killed while serving our country in Iraq. This represents 23 percent of all U.S. deaths in Iraq. 
   LCpl Samuel Tapia, age 20, died December 18 from small-arms fire while conducting combat operations in Ar Ramadi. He was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Twentynine Palms, CA. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, his unit was attached to the 2nd Marine Division.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to mark ``Juneteenth,'' the day in 1865 when General Gordon Granger issued his order proclaiming America's remaining slaves free. 
   On June 19, 1865, MG Gordon Granger and a group of Union soldiers landed at Galveston, TX. With their landing, they announced that the war had ended and that the slaves were now free. This was more than 2 years after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which had little impact in Texas. 
   Though initially celebrated in Galveston, TX, Juneteenth is now observed nationwide. Americans from all racial and ethnic backgrounds celebrate Juneteenth. And while this day holds a special resonance for descendants of slaves, Juneteenth provides an important opportunity for us all to commemorate a central tenent of our great country: that we are all created equal. This Juneteenth let us all celebrate this milestone in the struggle for liberty by recommitting ourselves to the advancement of justice for all. 
   The stain of slavery can never be erased from the history of our Nation, and should never be forgotten. In celebrating Juneteenth, we also honor those who suffered under slavery and help to further our understanding of our Nation's history. 
   One of the most common elements of Juneteenth celebrations is the singing of ``Lift Every Voice and Sing,'' written by James Weldon Johnson. I am happy to provide these lyrics of this great American song: 
   Lift Every Voice and Sing Lift every voice and sing Till earth and heaven ring,  Ring with the harmonies of Liberty; Let our rejoicing rise High as the listening skies, Let it resound loud as the rolling sea. Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us, Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us, Facing the rising sun of our new day begun Let us march on till victory is won. 
 Stony the road we trod, Bitter the chastening rod, Felt in the days when hope unborn had died; Yet with a steady beat, Have not our weary feet Come to the place for which our fathers sighed? We have come over a way that with tears have been watered, We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered, Out from the gloomy past, Till now we stand at last Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast. 
 God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, Thou who has brought us thus far on the way; Thou who has by Thy might Led us into the light, Keep us forever in the path, we pray. Lest our feet stray from the places, Our God, where we met Thee; Lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee; Shadowed beneath Thy hand, May we forever stand. True to our GOD, True to our native land.  
   --James Weldon Johnson.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. 
   Please join me as we celebrate the outstanding contributions of Asian Pacific Americans to our Nation during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. Since 1977, when Congressman Norman Mineta of San Jose, along with Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii, introduced a joint congressional resolution, we have celebrated Asian Pacific American--APA--cultures and traditions each May. They chose May for the observance because the first Japanese settlers had come to mainland America in May 1843, and the Nation's first transcontinental railroad was completed, with the help of Chinese American labor, in May 1869. This year, the theme is ``Celebrating Decades of Pride, Partnerships and Progress.'' 
   More than 14 million APAs live in the United States. Nearly 5 million APAs live in California, making it home to the largest population of Asian Pacific Americans in the Nation. It is no wonder, then, that the APA community in California has made tremendous strides by working together to bring about positive change and growth. I am so proud of my State of California for being a leader on Asian Pacific American issues. 
   Earlier this year, the California State Legislature's Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus held its 6th Annual APA Legislative Briefing, ``Partnering for Community Empowerment.'' The conference brought together statewide APA community leaders--from organizations such as the Asian Pacific Islanders California Action Network, Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum, and Asian Americans for Civil Rights and Equality--to create unique partnerships to advance civil rights, education, health care and community development. I commend the Asian Pacific Islander Caucus and California's APA community leaders for their tireless and innovative efforts to empower Asian Pacific Americans in California. 
   In addition to reflecting on the many accomplishments of the APA community, Asian Pacific American Heritage Month also allows us to honor the memory and contributions of notable Asian Pacific Americans. This year, sadly, we have lost many APA leaders: Dave Tatsuno, a courageous man who secretly documented life in a Japanese American internment camp during World War II; Sam Chu Lin, one of the first Asian American journalists in the United States; Judge Delbert Wong, the first Chinese American judge in the continental United States; and Jade Snow Wong, a world-renowned author and ceramicist. 
   All four of these APA leaders were undeterred in their efforts to make America a better place to live, and they will be missed by all who knew them. In remembering the accomplishments of Dave Tatsuno, Sam Chu Lin, Judge Delbert Wong, and Jade Snow Wong, I hope that future APAs will be inspired to become leaders who will fight for this great Nation and for the rights of all Asian Pacific Americans. 
   As we celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month this May, let us remember that Asian Pacific Americans are constantly contributing to every aspect of American life, from business and government to sports, science, and the arts. As we note their many contributions, let us celebrate diversity and recommit ourselves to working together toward a better future for us all.

   Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, Senator Frist came to the Senate to make some opening remarks about the class action bill that will be before the Senate. There will be a very good debate on this bill. I will make a couple of points. 
   The Senator said every 2 seconds a lawsuit is filed. I have no reason to doubt his number, but I wonder if he has looked at who is filing the lawsuits. The last time I 
   looked, it was mostly one business suing another business. So before we come to the Senate and say we have to do something about the class action lawsuits, saying every 2 seconds a lawsuit is filed gives the wrong impression. We are going to get the exact numbers, but I make that point. 
   What we will find among colleagues, regardless of party, we all want to make sure these lawsuits are fair and that they are heard in a fair way. It appears when a class action lawsuit winds up in a Federal court, the judge, on many occasions, if not most occasions, refuses to hear it because the plaintiffs come from so many different States. I will give an example of what these lawsuits are about. 
   When we talk about lawyers, we talk about fees, we talk about costs the lawyers have, or the time they have. We are overlooking the main point, which is: what are these class action lawsuits about? I will talk about a couple of these lawsuits because we need to put a human face on what they are. 
   Rob Sanders of Maryland explained how his daughter was killed, as were other children, by a deployed airbag in a Chrysler minivan. For years, consumers have pursued class action cases against Chrysler to force the company to replace existing airbags in such vehicles with others that deploy less rapidly and do not pose a safety risk to  the car's occupant. As someone who is small in stature, I can say the automobile companies make these airbags to protect people who are much larger and much heavier, and much taller than appropriate for children. We have seen children killed by these airbags. 
   We all want airbags that work, regardless of our weight, our height, or stature. A class action was blocked in a Louisiana Federal court because the judge threw up his hands. But in Oklahoma--as we all know, that is a conservative State--the State court is proceeding to look at this even though the company has been working for years to block it. We are talking about life and death. We are talking about real victims. 
   Let's talk about the ability to make a living. Georgie Hartwig of Washington State is a former Wal-Mart employee who was cheated out of overtime pay. This is a common practice, unfortunately, at many of the company stores. Her class action case is being heard in State court. Three Federal courts have refused to hear such Wal-Mart cases, whereas five State courts have allowed them. 
   I am hopeful as we move this bill forward, we will ensure that at least some court will hear these important cases. They involve real people. I am sure Georgie Hartwig of Washington State and her colleagues at Wal-Mart have to raise a family and pay the rent. If we have a system that simply shuts the courthouse door, be it a State courthouse or a Federal courthouse, we are not fulfilling our job to make sure people get justice, they get it expeditiously, and it is done fairly. 
   Shelly Toliver is a firefighter from Connecticut. These are the people we are talking about here--Americans. Shelly Toliver, a firefighter from Connecticut, described how she brought a State class action suit against Credit Acceptance Corporation of Michigan for cheating her and other consumers out of their vehicles in violation of Connecticut law, 
   destroying their credit ratings in the process. We all know what it is to get a bad credit rating by mistake. It is terrible. Ultimately, the class members had their purported debt to the company wiped out and their bad ratings cleared because they were able to get their case heard. 
   It goes on and on. I hope as we get through this bill we will be honest with the American people regarding whose rights are at stake. We are supposed to be here for the rights of the men and women of this country, the families of this country. The corporations, which are rather faceless, I support when they do the right thing, but when they do not do the right thing, when they wrong a firefighter, if an automobile company does not do what they should to protect children, there ought to be justice. That is all we are saying. 
   Are there abuses? Yes. Should we resolve them? Yes. I am very happy to do that. It is true, we have abuses everywhere. We should fix those abuses. 
   We have to be careful we are being sincere. There is one colleague who has been very strong on capping pain and suffering, but when it happened in his own family, he went for the gold. So let's be careful. The American people are watching. If we say we ought to cap pain and suffering for our constituents--forget about it, one size fits all. This is not class action, but these are other kinds of cases this Republican Senate is coming after: one size fits all. Let's cap it it is killing us; it is killing the country. 
   I go to the supermarket every week. No one comes up to me and says, please, please, do something about the filing of lawsuits when their child died in a hospital. What they will say to me is, make sure there is fairness for victims. 
   Let's get together and do the things that have to be done so that the people who get the benefit are our constituents. Do not close the courthouse door to firefighters, moms and dads, who are working for justice in their lives.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to close on a couple of topics. The first one, because I sit on the Foreign Relations Committee, is the nomination of John Bolton to be our Ambassador to the United Nations. I do call on the President to rethink this nomination. Out of the thousands of strong, conservative Republicans who care about the world, there has to be somebody better than someone who has a pattern of not only abusing his staff, called a serial abuser by one witness, but also, and this is really threatening, trying to get them fired if they do not give him the information he wants. 
   I am talking about false information and reaching down from the very high level at which he has been to the bottom of another agency that he did not even have direct line control over and trying to force not one but two and maybe three intelligence analysts to paint a picture that he wanted to use so that he could present a country as an imminent threat to this Nation, which could have led to some serious ramifications. Of all the people to pick now, it should not be someone who would try to politicize intelligence gathering. 
   I received another letter on Friday, which I sent to both sides of the committee. I hope this will be looked at. It concerns a case where years ago John Bolton was trying to overturn a U.N. resolution--or have it modified--that dealt with infant formula in the developing nations. Some of my colleagues may remember that issue, where babies were dying throughout the developing world because they were mixing the baby formula with contaminated water, and the U.N. voted very strongly to stop distributing and selling that baby formula. According to this woman, who has a lot of credentials--an attorney who worked with John Bolton--she said that Bolton ordered her to contact these developing nations and tell them to back off and modify this resolution so that Nestle Company and others could sell their product in the developing world. And this is interesting--conscience clause--she said: My conscience does not allow me to do this because if one baby died as a result of what I did, I could not live with myself. There is a conscience clause in the agency that says if somebody has a conscience problem when given an assignment, they do not have to do it. Well, Bolton said, if you do not do this, you are fired, and he fired her on the spot, according to her. She is going to go under oath and testify to this. 
   Then he found out he could not fire her because she was protected by Civil Service. She comes back to work, and what do they find? Her entire office had been moved. Where is it moved? To the basement of the building. No telephone. A desk and a chair. She loved her job, and she eventually got a telephone down there and worked around John Bolton and stayed there doing her work. 
   This is yet another story. So we have a pattern of abusive behavior. Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle say, this is just the person we need for the U.N.--somebody tough. If you want someone in the U.N. who has a history of trying to change intelligence information--and now the world knows it. 
   As my ranking member JOE BIDEN has stated, this is the guy who may have to make the intelligence case against Iran. This is the guy who may have to make the intelligence case against North Korea with this background of using political pressure to get the kind of intelligence he wanted to build a case. This is not the right person. We do not want someone there who will politicize intelligence gathering. I don't think we want someone there who is such a hothead that it will turn a lot of people off. 
   We have testimony from multiple sources. At first, my friends on the other side of the committee said it is an isolated incident; you are talking about one incident. We have incident after incident. 
   Oh, he is just the person we need. We want someone tough. Tough is one thing. Tough and principled and committed is one thing. Abusing people is something else. A man is called a serial abuser by someone who has the credentials to know--e-mails back this up--trying to get people fired because they want to do their job. 
   It was so bad that Colin Powell, the Secretary of State, had to actually go and talk to all these ``independent'' analysts; his message was, don't you worry about it. You continue to do your work. I thank him for that. The testimony is clear. He went there and told those analysts, don't you be bullied. I am using those words. But the message he had was, don't you worry about it. Do your work. Do your job. It is very clear. 
   How refreshing it was to see Senator Voinovich, at the committee, listen to what Senator Biden, in particular, was saying. They had the information, chapter and verse, proof of why this is not a good appointment. 
   I know the pressures that have come to bear on Senator Voinovich. It is not pleasant to be alone. I have been there. I know how it feels. But he is answering to his conscience. I think he did the Senate proud by doing that. 
   Now we hear other colleagues on the committee saying maybe they need more time and more information. 
   Again, this can all be avoided. There are so many other people who can do this job. I said before that John Bolton is very loyal to this conservative doctrine. There could be many positions for him in the administration. We need someone in the spirit of John Danforth--Republican, conservative, wonderful former Senator who went to the United Nations, who immediately had the support and the credibility and the respect. 
   In closing, I will talk about an issue I know the Presiding Officer has been very involved with, and that is the filibuster issue. As someone who once wanted to end a filibuster myself at an early stage, I now understand how foolish I was at that point. Why did I want it to end when I first came here as freshman? We had the majority and the Republicans were thwarting us. It was very frustrating. We wanted to fix everything. I voted to say this filibuster has to go. 
   Little did I realize that is the way the Senate is supposed to operate in a deliberative fashion. As one of the Founders said, the House is the cup. It gets hot. It is steaming. And when the issues get to the Senate, it is the saucer. They cool down. One of the ways to ensure that is to have extended debate.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to commemorate the 91st anniversary of the Armenian genocide on April 24th. This anniversary offers an opportunity for us to renew our  efforts to achieve--finally--genocide recognition for the Armenian people. 
   Ninety-one years ago, the Ottoman Turks began their systematic effort to eradicate the Armenian people. From 1915 until 1923, 1.5 million Armenians were tortured and killed; men were separated from their families and murdered; women and children were forced to march across the Syrian desert without water, food, or possessions; many died of hunger or thirst or were killed when they lagged behind during the forced marches into the desert. 
   The brutality of the genocide was atrocious. But the inhumanity continues today because the Turkish Government refuses to acknowledge the massacres as genocide. The wounds cannot heal until the Armenian people receive recognition. 
   The Armenian genocide was the first genocide of the 20th century. But as we have seen, it was not the last. As we know, if we ignore injustice, we are likely to see it repeated. In his justification for the Holocaust, Adolf Hitler said, ``Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?'' And today, we see ongoing atrocities in the Darfur region of Sudan, with innocent civilians being murdered. In the 108th Congress, I cosponsored a resolution declaring that the atrocities in Darfur constitute genocide. 
   I am currently a cosponsor of a resolution calling the President to ensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the record of the United States relating to the Armenian genocide and the consequences of the failure to realize a just resolution. And I have signed onto a letter urging President Bush to honor the historic leadership of the United States in defending human rights and to properly characterize the atrocities against the Armenian people as genocide in his April 24th statement. 
   Every year, we move closer to recognition of the Armenian genocide. But every year, we wonder how long it will take the Government of Turkey to acknowledge the genocide. 
   We need genocide recognition to honor those 1.5 million Armenians who lost their lives and to honor the survivors who are still with us today. We need recognition to send a message to the 8 to 10 million Armenians worldwide that they have not been forgotten. We need genocide recognition to remind the world that crimes against humanity are crimes against us all. And we need genocide recognition because it is the right thing to do. 
   By acknowledging this genocide for what it is, I hope that we are able to help create a more just and humane world.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, while a complete response to my request remains outstanding, I have determined that with the additional commitments I received today, the confirmation of Ms. Bodine can proceed with the expectation and assurance from Ms. Bodine to work closely with me and provide cooperation on the oversight of this program. 
   In addition, the Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator INHOFE, has agreed that the Superfund program and its critical missions are overdue for a comprehensive oversight hearing and that such a hearing shall be held in the Superfund and Waste Management Subcommittee of which I am ranking member. Senator THUNE, the chairman of the subcommittee, has also agreed to this request. 
   There have been no comprehensive oversight hearings of this important public health program in over 3 years. Ms. Bodine has agreed to testify at this hearing after her confirmation, and we will have other outside witnesses as well. We have also requested that Administrator Stephen Johnson be available as well. I want to thank my colleague, Senator INHOFE for agreeing to this critical hearing.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the outstanding accomplishments of the University of Southern California football team. Earlier this month, the Trojans completed a perfect season by winning the Orange Bowl and their second consecutive national championship. 
   Last year, USC shared the championship after being excluded from the Bowl Championship Series title game. 
   This year, there was no doubt. The Trojans won all 13 of their games and led both the Associated Press and the USA Today/ESPN coaches polls from the preseason through the bowl games. 
   On Tuesday, January 4, they ended the season with a bang. In a much-anticipated meeting with second-ranked Oklahoma, the Trojans overwhelmed the Sooners by a score of 55-19 to win the Orange Bowl and the national championship in utterly convincing fashion. 
   I would like to congratulate USC President Steven B. Sample, Head Coach Pete Carroll, and the Trojan football team for an unforgettable season.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been watching the developments on the Senate floor with, let's say, much surprise. It is very hard for me to understand why this Senate would not want to go on record in opposition to the Dubai ports deal when we have an opportunity to do that, to dispose of that amendment by Senator Schumer and go right back to the ethics reform bill that is before the Senate. 
   I thank Senator Schumer for his courage because I know how it is around here sometimes. You need courage to say: Look, this is so important I am not going to back down. Senator Schumer explained that he and his colleagues from New York and New Jersey and Connecticut suffered the biggest blow on 9/11, although, believe me, the whole country suffered a blow--certainly in Pennsylvania directly and in my home State of California, where all those planes were going. We lost many people on that day. 
   But Senator Schumer explains that when you tell the people at home: I am going to do everything in my power so that we never have another 9/11, you better mean it. You better mean it. That means you have to step up to the plate. If you believe this deal presents a danger to our security, you have to step up to the plate, you have to use every legislative prerogative at your disposal, and you have to say to your colleagues: I am sorry, we are going to take 5 minutes out, we are going to take 10 minutes out, we are going to take 15 minutes out of this bill, and we are going to vote on this. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, God bless them--I know they must have a reason for this--they have stopped us from voting. They have stopped us from voting to 
   stop this Dubai ports deal. Why is it important? There are so many reasons. This deal involves a port operator that is fully owned and controlled by a foreign country. Do we, in a post-9/11 world, want to have our very important infrastructure controlled by another country? I say no. Pre-9/11 we didn't think this way so much. 
   We had a situation, Senator Feinstein and I, in Long Beach, the Los Angeles port, where China took over the running of a terminal. We were very concerned. This was in about 1997, well before 9/11. We were concerned then, and we asked for a special report from then-Secretary of Defense Cohen and Sandy Berger--he was our National Security Adviser. We asked them to do a written report to us before we let that go through. I believe now it ought to be looked at again. Not only that, but for all of the other ports that are being operated by foreign countries, we ought to have a look back. We ought to see if that is the right thing to do. 
   But one thing I know for sure, today, this deal has to stop. We have a chance here, thanks to Senator Schumer, who took a lot of abuse--maybe not publicly but privately--for having the courage to do this. We have to have a vote. It is amazing to me that those on the other side would stop us. 
   This is the same group who said to the Democrats: You better step back and let us have a vote on every judge we want, you better step back and let us have votes on all these things, and they will not let us have a vote on the most sacred responsibility we have, which is to keep our country safe. 
   Let the American people understand what this is about. It is not as if we have done so much for port security in this Congress. We have gotten failing grades for what we have failed to do on port security. It is not for lack of trying. 
   I want to show you how many amendments we voted on, to try to increase port security, and what happened. In the 107th Congress, $585 million increase for port security in the fiscal year 2003 appropriations; another vote, $500 million increase for port security; another vote, $200 million increase for the Coast Guard; $1 billion for port security. Guess what happened in the 107th Congress. Every one of those amendments went down. Every one of those amendments went down because my colleagues on the other side pretty much voted party line, voted down. 
   What happened in the 108th Congress? An amendment for a $460 million increase for port security plus a $70 million increase for the Coast Guard for homeland security was voted down; $450 million increase for port security, voted down; $100 million increase--we went at it again and again--voted down; $324 million increase for the Coast Guard, voted down; $80 million increase for the Coast Guard, voted down; $150 million increase for port security grants, voted down. 
   My colleagues on the other side voted down every one of these while they voted for tax breaks for the most wealthy Americans who already earn $1 million a year. 
   I hope the American people are catching on to what is going on. Had we done some of these things and you had the country, the United Arab Emirates, that had connections to 9/11--two of the hijackers were from there. We know that money was laundered for the operation through Dubai. We know that Dr. Khan, the Pakistani scientist who turned on the civilized world and smuggled nuclear components to Iran, to North Korea, and to Libya--how did he smuggle those? Through the port of Dubai. And what we are going to do is reward these people, is give them the right to operate a terminal. 
   Then you hear from my colleagues: Oh, the terminal operator has nothing to do with security. 
   Wrong. We have a letter from the No. 2 man at the Port Authority in New Jersey and New York. Do you know what he said? The terminal operator is one of the major players in port security. They are the ones who decide who gets hired. They are the ones who do the background checks.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, here is the letter. They hired two security guards--that would be the Dubai people--and purchased the technology that will protect the terminal properties. They have control over who can enter and exit a facility. They have their own systems for checking and identifying workers. 
   Let me tell you that the terminal operators, according to the people who know best, are very much into the loop of security. As a matter of fact, they are deemed one of the main players. That is what they are called--main players in port security consisting of Customs, Border Patrol, Coast Guard, Immigration, Customs enforcement, and the terminal operators. 
   If anyone says to you it doesn't matter who loses the terminal, you just relate to them that we know better. When Senator Stevens had the CCO of Dubai Ports World before our committee, I said to him: What do you think about the fact that this Dr. Kahn got all of these smuggled nuclear components through Port of Dubai? 
   Do you know what he said? This is the chief corporate officer of Dubai Ports World. He said, ``We don't know anything about it. We never look at containers.'' 
   Can you imagine? So here it is. We have a chance to stop this Dubai Ports deal in its tracks. To do so is in the best interests of the people of this country. To do so would be reflective of what the House of Representatives did yesterday in their Appropriations Committee. To do so is our highest responsibility to the people of this country. To do so is common sense. To do so is to stand for the security of this country. 
   This deal is greased. The underlying bill that Senator Schumer attached this to, you and I, Mr. President, could live by the rules of this bill. And I intend to do it whether it is passed today, tomorrow, or next week. But we have to stop this deal from going forward. Listen, that deal was greased. That deal was greased. The President is all for it. He said: I didn't know anything about it. But 50 seconds later he was all for it. 
   This is our only chance today, unless there is an agreement to have a stand-alone bill. I hope colleagues will fight for the right to vote for this important amendment. Thank you very much.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada. I rise to speak as a mother and a grandmother--a mother of a daughter and a son, a grandmother of a grandson, and a Senator who has been here now for three terms, and I served over in the House for many years--to say that my friend from Nevada is right that this is not a parental consent bill at all. 
   Some States have parental consent laws, some don't. In my particular State, it has been voted down because my people feel that if you ask them do they want their kids to come to their parents, absolutely. But if you ask them should you force them to do so, even in circumstances where there could be trouble that comes from that, they say no. 
   I respect those States that have parental consent laws, and perhaps we will have a law that is drafted in California that the voters will approve. So far, we have not seen that. 
   It is true it is not a partisan issue. When we voted down those laws, we did it regardless of political party. But the reason is unintended consequences in the way certain bills are drafted. I want to speak to that because I believe this bill is well-intentioned. 
   This bill emanates from a desire that our children come to us when we have family matters, when our children are in trouble, that they not be fearful, that they not be afraid that they disappoint us, that they be open with us and loving toward us, and we toward them. This is what we want to have happen. 
   The question is: Can Big Brother Federal Government force this on our families? That is where we will differ. 
   I have to tell you, as I look at this bill coming before us now, I have to ask the question: why are my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who run this place, who run the House, who run the White House, putting so much effort into this bill, having killed stem cell research, which all of our families are desperate to have--talk about 80 percent of America, it is 90 percent who want to find cures to Alzheimer's and all the rest. Oh, no, instead of getting another chance to pass that bill and convince the President, who is now backing off a little bit in his rhetoric, to sign a stem cell research bill, or to prevent teen pregnancies, which is so important, we don't have that. We have this bill that impacts very few people. Instead of improving the health of women and girls, we are spending precious time on a bill that, in essence, protects incest predators. This bill, as it is written, protects fathers who commit incest. Can you imagine? It allows them to drive their daughter across State lines. Unbelievable. We are going to try to fix this problem with an amendment. I hope my colleagues will support that, and it will improve this bill. 
   Right now, imagine, a father retains parental rights if he has committed rape on his daughter. This is supposed to be a warm and fuzzy bill? I don't think so. It also throws grandmothers in jail.

   Mrs. BOXER. When I am finished. 
   This bill, as it is drafted, will throw a grandmother in jail. Say the father committed incest on the daughter and she is hysterical. The first place she goes is not some judge but to her grandma, who she adores and who gives her unconditional love, or to her priest or rabbi, and says please help me out of this. That incestuous father, as the bill is written, can sue that caring adult who takes her over the line. 
   My friend is going to offer an amendment that goes part of the way on the incest provision. It will say the father cannot sue. I am so happy because I will join him in that. I hope we have a 100-to-0 vote. But I am shocked that we  cannot reach agreement on that. Talk about finding common ground. Even with the Ensign amendment that says a father cannot sue, he can still take the daughter across State lines. And the Federal Government can still sue the grandmother or the clergy. 
   This debate is just beginning. The Senator from Nevada and I are friends, but we will have a tough debate. I hope we will vote for the Democratic amendment to improve this bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to 20 young Americans who have been killed in Iraq since October 7. This brings to 477 the number of soldiers who were either from California or based in California who have been killed while serving our country in Iraq. This represents 23 percent of all U.S. deaths in Iraq.

   Mrs. BOXER. The President has sent down his budget. We are going through it now to see what it means for our State. But this is quite a budget. This is a budget that does not include the costs of the war in Iraq. This is a budget that does not include the costs of the war in Afghanistan. This is a budget that does not show the true costs of making the tax cuts permanent. This is a budget that does not show the costs of what I call anti-Social Security, going into personal accounts, which is an enormous multitrillion dollar cost. 
   So you have a document which is, on its face, incomplete. That is the best way I can put it: incomplete. Other people might use another word for it, but I will be charitable and say it is incomplete. Why can't the President show the true costs? Because he could not hold up his head if he put the true costs in there. We would be looking at deficits that are ruinous. The truth is, the deficits are ruinous. 
   When President Bush took over, he had a surplus as far as the eye could see. He turned it into a deficit in 15 minutes. He said the tax cuts would be so great that we would have economic growth and we would suddenly have a balanced budget. It did not happen. 
   Let me tell you what else is not in this budget. Where is the money from the Iraqi oil that was supposed to be coming our way? On March 27, 2003, not that long ago, this is what Paul Wolfowitz, the Assistant Secretary of Defense said, in congressional testimony, sworn to tell the truth:  
   The oil revenues of Iraq could bring between $50 and $100 billion over the course of the next two or three years. ..... We're dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.  
   Let me repeat that. A Bush administration spokesperson, very high up in the Defense Department, said:  
   The oil revenues of Iraq could bring between $50 and $100 billion over the course of the next two or three years. ..... We're dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon.  
   Well, here it is, folks, it is 3 years later, and not a penny of revenue is coming into our budget to help us, and the whole cost of the Iraq war is outside the budget--a disaster. 
   Here is another claim, by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer:  
   Iraq, unlike Afghanistan, is a rather wealthy country. Iraq has tremendous resources that belong to the Iraqi people. And so there are a variety of means that Iraq has to be able to shoulder much of the burden for their own reconstruction.  
   Where is the revenue in our budget? Not a dime, not one slim dime. They are not even talking about making these costs into loans against future oil revenues. And in the meantime, what are the American people told by this President and his budget? What are the veterans told? Oh, we are cutting back on veterans health care. Can you imagine? We are almost at 11,000 wounded, and this President's budget says, You are going to have to pay more for your pharmaceuticals, $250 to join, and you have to pay more. Let me tell you, a lot of us are going to stop that. Let me tell you, a lot of us are not going to let that happen. 
   The people coming home from Iraq, half of them are very seriously wounded--thousands and thousands. Some estimates are that a third of them need mental health care. And this budget cuts veterans health. Wrong. That is not going to happen. It is unacceptable. I think it is unacceptable to the American people. 
   I ask my constituents if they believe we ought to be doing more for veterans or less for the veterans or the same as we did last year. I know--and I have not taken a scientific poll--they would say: Senator, you give them 
   what they need. 
   The President says to the Iraqi people: As long as it takes. Whatever it is. Whatever it costs. I want to say to the veterans: Whatever it takes, however long it takes for you to get on your feet, we will be there. 
   We have the President eliminating a program where the Federal Government gives States funding to incarcerate illegal immigrants who have committed crimes--cut, gone, finito, finished--eliminating $300 million. We call it SCAAP. How can a President, at this time in our history, where we are guarding our borders, where we are concerned about who is coming in, lay all of that on the border States? This is wrong. It is unacceptable. 
   How about this: The Bush budget slices law enforcement grants to States from $2.8 billion to $1.5 billion, while the President claims he is increasing homeland defense. 
   I have a message for the President, in a nice, respectful way: It is our local law enforcement people who are protecting our citizens in every capacity. They are the bottom line of homeland defense.  
   There is a special and important program to assist police departments to improve technology and their ability to communicate with other agencies through COPS technology grants. Do you know what happens if there is an emergency in one area? What we have found out is, our police departments, our fire departments, our first responders do not have the equipment they need. They do not have the communications equipment. They cannot talk to each other. 
   The Senate, in a bipartisan way, passed authorizing legislation to say we need to help connect these departments with one another. Because suppose something happens on a railroad track, and one sheriff sees it, and there is a disaster, and he needs to get on the line immediately to all the other agencies in the area; they cannot do it right now. They need to move toward the ability to do this. It seems shocking that we have not done that already in America, but that is the truth. What does the President do? He cuts that program. He eliminates it. 
   Now, the President also creates a new program. He wants to extend the No Child Left Behind to high school. Well, how about fully funding his first No Child Left Behind? I wrote the part with Senator Ensign that deals with afterschool programs. It has been frozen for 3 years. There are millions of kids who want to get into afterschool programs. 
   We know it works. Law enforcement loves the program. The teachers love the program because the kids get to do their homework. They stay out of trouble. The FBI loves the program. The FBI has told us the vast majority of juvenile crime occurs right after school until the parents come home. We did not need the FBI to tell us that. We kind of figured that out. But this is key. 
   So here we are with a new program to extend No Child Left Behind to high school kids when we have not fully funded the afterschool program and many of the other programs that were promised to our people in the first No Child Left Behind. That is $1.4 billion, folks. This is not small change. This is $1.4 billion for this new program. There are no revenues in there from Iraqi oil. 
   This is also the first administration not to back a polluter-pay fee. When polluters cause these superfunds, where we have toxics all over the ground seeping into 
   the water, it costs a lot of money to clean it up. This is the first administration, Republican or Democratic, not to support this polluter-pay fee. That would bring billions in over 5 years. 
   There are ways for us to pay for things the American people need. I am looking forward to getting into more of the fine print of this particular budget. I used to be on the Budget Committee. I can tell you, I loved being on the Budget Committee because it was a way to look at the big picture. When I went on the Commerce Committee, I had to give up the Budget Committee. It was a sad decision for me. But I look forward to hearing from KENT CONRAD and I look forward to hearing from the Republican chairman, who was PETE DOMENICI, and I am not sure if it has changed or not. Because I want to hear their take on this budget. 
   But we see new initiatives in this budget that obviously are not paid for when we are shorting probably 150 programs, according to the President. We see nothing in here about getting any revenues from the Iraqi oil that were promised to us: $50 to $100 billion over the course of the next 2 or 3 years we were told by this administration in 2003. I believe in holding people accountable when they say things. I think it is important. That is what they said, and we do not see any evidence of any of this in this budget. 
   So we have the budget to deal with. We have the class action lawsuit legislation, which I hope we can do in a way to protect the important lawsuits that need to be heard and need to be resolved. Because if they are heard and they are resolved, our people will be safer, our people will be stronger, our people will feel they have been given justice. 
   We have the Social Security, what I call, repeal. Not a penny has been put into this budget to reflect any of that. 
   I understand my time is up. There is no one on the floor so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, California and the Nation have lost a unique leader with the passing of former Congressman Ed Roybal. 
   In 1922, Ed Roybal moved to Los Angeles from New Mexico with his parents. He graduated from Roosevelt High School and attended UCLA before going off to fight in World War II. When he returned from the war, he returned to Los Angeles and joined the County's Department of Health Education in its County Tuberculosis and Health Association. 
   In 1947, Ed Roybal decided to run for a seat on the Los Angeles City Council in a district that was remarkably diverse and included Boyle Heights, Bunker Hill, Civic Center, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, and the Central Avenue District. Though he lost this race, he returned in 1949, winning in the same district. In part, his victory was based on a well organized effort to register Latino voters in the district. With this victory, he became the first Latino to serve on the Los Angeles City Council since 1881. He would serve on the council until 1962, when he was elected to the U.S. Congress. 
   When he took his seat in the House of Representatives in Washington, DC, Ed Roybal remembered his constituents and his roots. He worked tirelessly to ensure that Latinos were represented and that their interests were not diluted by redistricting changes. He often stood alone in these efforts. 
   Ed Roybal was also a tireless advocate for the elderly, and the working poor. He served as chairman of both the Select Committee on Aging and the Subcommittee on Health and Long Term Care, guiding legislation on health care, Social Security, housing and human services. He also helped to establish important programs in southern California, including scholarship programs at local colleges and universities. 
   In 1992, Ed Roybal was fourth in seniority in the House of Representatives and known as a legislator's legislator, crafting and passing landmark legislation. It was then that he opted for retirement, with his daughter, LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD, running for and winning his seat. A generation of Latino leaders have followed in Ed Roybal's steps, including his daughter. It is very fitting that Congresswoman Roybal-Allard's office can be found in the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles. I ask my colleagues to join me in sending my deepest condolences to Congresswoman Roybal-Allard and her family on their personal loss. 
   California and its leadership have undergone remarkable changes since Ed Roybal first ran and won a seat on the Los Angeles City Council in 1949 and was later elected to Congress in 1962. Following his leadership and example, Latinos are represented in the Congress, in the state legislature and lead our most populous cities. And people across our Nation who depend on Social Security, who need medical care and who work for fair and representative elections can be grateful today for Ed Roybal's vital service to our Nation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Frist was true to his word. He told me I could have a vote to repeal what I consider to be a very dangerous amendment that came into an appropriations bill without any hearings, without any discussions, without any votes, and I think could very well lead to a very dangerous situation for the women of our country. 
   I decided not to push the vote. It was too close to call. Some people said  there were 56 votes against us. That was not my count, but I knew that in order to win this vote I needed to talk with people individually at great length. 
   Why is that? Because this is one of the most confusing amendments that we have ever faced in the Senate. Just ask the people at HHS, who are trying to implement it. Just ask the people who filed suit. They say it is so vague and so broad that it could literally mean people coming into an emergency room, not getting served, and dying in an emergency room. This is what could happen. 
   I thank Senator Frist for being true to his word, for giving me the opportunity, and I want to briefly explain what I plan to do about this Weldon amendment, with the help of my friends and colleagues. 
   Senator Harkin and I plan to work across the aisle to modify this amendment so that it really is what it claims to be, a conscience clause. No one objects to conscience clauses. I support them. Conscious clauses are in the law. I am happy to clarify them, make sure anyone who has a moral objection to performing an abortion absolutely has every right not to have to do that. 
   I have talked at length with Senator Harkin, and we are going to work with our colleagues. That means with Senator Specter and the other members of the Appropriations Committee so they understand the ramifications of this Weldon amendment, which I will go into in a minute. 
   Second, as I mentioned, there have been lawsuits 
   filed challenging the constitutionality of the Weldon amendment. I believe the arguments are compelling. As I have said before--and we were proven right when other anti-choice amendments that were thrown out of court--I believe this one also will be thrown out. Because it cannot possibly be that any judge anywhere, regardless of whether he or she is liberal, conservative, moderate, Republican, Democrat, or anything else, would put women's lives in danger like this could do. So I feel very confident it will come out all right. 
   I am going to give a brief discussion on what I think the Weldon amendment means as it is now written. 
   Although the proponents of the Weldon amendment call it a conscience clause, nowhere in the amendment do we see the words ``religion,'' ``morals,'' ``beliefs,'' or ``values.'' It is masquerading as a conscience clause, but it really is not. I call it a denial clause because it will deny women emergency care when their lives are in danger, deny low-income rape victims reproductive health care, deny doctors the right to give their patients vital information, and deny States the ability to enforce critical laws ensuring the health of women. 
   The fact is, our hospitals and doctors already have a Federal conscience clause, it's called the 1973 Church Amendment. What Weldon does is different. It's a big loophole that allows anyone, including HMOs, to decide, for any reason, that they do not want any of their doctors not only not performing abortions but also telling a woman that it is a legal right for her, referring her, talking to her honestly about what her options are. 
   This amendment is giving a denial clause to an HMO which, by the way, I do not think they have a conscience, given the way many of them treat people. So we are giving the HMO, a corporation, a big denial clause--not the doctor, not the nurse but the corporation. So that means they can now gag doctors who work for them by telling them: You better not inform a woman about her rights because if you do, it is against the guidelines of this HMO. 
   Now, in this Weldon amendment, there is no exception for rape or incest. Imagine, there is no exception for rape and incest. So even if a woman comes in who has been brutally raped or the victim of incest, under this Weldon amendment, the hospital or the HMO could violate current law and say: So sorry about that, you are on your own. Now, this is America in 2005. Where is our conscience? Where are our moral values? Where are our family values if we pass an amendment like this, that would throw a woman out in the most dire of circumstances? It is just horrific. 
   And this goes against our Medicaid law. The Hyde amendment makes an exception for rape and incest if a woman is on Medicaid and if she is poor. HENRY HYDE and I talked about that quite a bit, and he supported that very much. First the exception was if one's life is at stake, they can get Medicaid help to end the pregnancy. Then it was rape and incest. There is no such exception in Weldon, and guess what happens. If the Medicaid law is enforced, states can now lose all of their Federal funds for education, labor, and health. This is just crazy. It makes no sense at all. 
   We believe that Weldon would allow a woman to die in an emergency room. There are very unbelievably tragic stories. Let us say a woman is in a car accident while she is in the early stages of her pregnancy. She is rushed into the emergency room, and she is losing blood. The only way to save her life is to terminate the pregnancy. Under Weldon, if the hospital says, I am sorry, we do not do that, she could just simply die waiting for help. This is what Weldon does. This is why I cannot believe a judge is going to allow it to continue. 
   So the Weldon amendment is drawn in such a way that all the laws we have--including the emergency room law ensuring a hospital takes measures to stabilize patients if their lives are endanger and the Medicaid law that allows a woman to get an abortion if she is raped or the victim of incest--are overridden by Weldon. Any State law that steps in to help guarantee reproductive services and referrals to woman is overridden by Weldon. And if States enforces their own law to help a woman in a crisis, they can lose all of their Federal funds, not just their family planning funds but every dollar of their education money, their labor money, and their health money. We are talking about billions of dollars across the board. 
   We all know it is totally unconstitutional to gag a doctor. Every year the anti-choice people pass a Mexico City gag rule, which I am proud to say the Senate does not support, but the President does, and it always manages to survive. The gag rule is in effect abroad, but they cannot do it here. Why? Because in this country we have freedom of speech, and a gag cannot be put around a doctor's mouth and tell them they cannot let their patients know all of their options; that is unconstitutional. But here, under Weldon, an HMO can gag any doctor that works for it. So it is really completely outrageous. 
   In essence, we are going to have a whole series of laws overturned by the Weldon amendment. The odd thing is, if the backers of the Weldon amendment would come to the table and tell us all the things they want to do, we could have an honest debate. The trouble we have is that the people who support Weldon will say: All we have is a conscience clause. But that isn't the case. 
   We have letters from doctors, patients, States, and we have lawsuits that really unmask the true ramifications of Weldon. What we have is a provision that masquerades as a conscience clause when it is really a denial clause that would punish States. These are the people who I thought liked States rights. 
   Let us take the issue of hospital mergers. In the past, under current law, every State in the Union that I know of has the ability, when a hospital merges, to set conditions for those mergers. The attorneys general of those States have the right to put conditions on those mergers. Under Weldon, that's no longer possible if such conditions include making sure that in this merger a woman has still reproductive health care. So it is taking away the rights of States, and that is again why I believe we can fix this, because it is so dangerous in its current form. 
   We have this amendment masquerading as a conscience clause. But it is not a conscience clause, it is a denial clause because it will deny women the health care they need to live, to be helped and saved in an emergency. It will gag doctors. It will stop attorneys general in all of our States from carrying out their duties. A couple of States have sued on behalf of this. Many who must implement it have thrown their hands up. They do not know how to enforce it. It never had a hearing in the Senate. We never looked at it, and it passed as part of the appropriations bill.  
   Again, I thank Senator Frist for living up to his commitment he made to me. I appreciate it. What we are going to do is continue to work to let everyone know how outrageous this law is, how far reaching this law is, how dangerous this law is to women, how it walks away from family values, from States rights, from anything decent when one says to a woman who has been raped or is the victim of incest that she is on her own. That is not what this country is about. 
   At some point, we are going to make sure that this Weldon amendment is either modified so it becomes what it says it is, which is a conscience clause that no one has an objection to, or is repealed. 
   How much more time do I have remaining?

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the fiscal year 2006 Labor-HHS appropriations conference report because it undermines many of our Nation's highest priorities and jeopardizes our most vulnerable citizens and communities. 
   We have all heard the dire warnings about the avian flu pandemic. We know that we need to invest adequate resources to develop vaccines, stockpile medicines, and better prepare at the local, State, and Federal levels. That is why the Senate passed Senator HARKIN's amendment. Yet this conference report left out those vital funds and, in doing so, left us far less equipped to deal with a pandemic. 
   We know we must invest in the critical research that uncovers the secrets behind our greatest killers, saving the health and lives of our citizens. Yet this bill increases funding for the National Institutes of Health, NIH, by less than one percent, the smallest increase since 1970. Make no mistake: this will lead to cuts in the number of new research grants funded by NIH. 
   We know we have to invest in the education of our children at every level of schooling. We know our school districts, and our children, are being asked to meet tougher standards. Yet this conference report cuts education for the first time in a decade. No Child Left Behind, NCLB, programs have been cut 3 percent, now leaving them $13 billion below the authorized level. Fewer children will be served by afterschool programs, which keep our children safe after school and improve their academic performance. At a time when the costs of college are skyrocketing, this bill once again freezes Pell grants, which help low-income students afford a college education. 
   Now, this bill doesn't just cut critical funds; it also adds provisions that endanger our neediest citizens. None is more troubling to me than the Weldon amendment. I am extremely disappointed that the conference report rejected the real conscience clause in the Senate bill and instead included the House bill's sweeping and dangerous refusal clause. 
   Unlike the Senate language authored by Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN, the provision in this conference report is not a conscience clause. It never mentions religion or morals. It forces States to choose between losing billions of dollars in funding or enforcing Federal and State laws ensuring reproductive health information and services for women. And it could have devastating consequences, including further endangering women in emergency situations, allowing doctors to be gagged, hurting victims of rape and incest, and seriously undermining state sovereignty. 
   Mr. President, if we want to really meet the great challenges we face in our country, we must reject this bill. The American people deserve better and we, as Senators, can certainly do better.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today to double the funding for veterans mental health care over the next 5 years. 
   Our brave veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have faced unspeakable horrors. They have seen people killed and wounded, experienced the stress of urban warfare, and endured other traumatic events. These experiences undoubtedly take their toll. However, it can take months or even years for these events to impact a person's mental health. 
   The need for this legislation is clear. Just today, the Washington Post reported that more than one in three soldiers and Marines who have served in Iraq later sought help for mental health problems. And we already know that the Veterans' Administration treated almost 19,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans for post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, between 2002 and 2005. These numbers will continue to increase. 
   This legislation will help ensure that the VA has the resources necessary to treat veterans with mental illness. First, it authorizes the VA to spend at least $3.6 billion in 2007--up from $2.8 billion in 2006--and increases funding to $5.6 billion by 2011. Second, it requires an annual report about progress in implementing milestones from the VA Mental Health Strategic Plan. 
   This bill is supported by AMVETS and Disabled American Veterans. 
   It is imperative that we make a long-term commitment to provide mental health services to our veterans, who have sacrificed so much for us. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution today expressing the sense of the Senate that a ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'' should be established. I join Representative LINDA S&#193;NCHEZ in this effort and applaud her for previously submitting this resolution in the House of Representatives. Establishing this day would be an appropriate way to honor members of the United States Armed Forces who bravely and faithfully served during the Vietnam War. 
   During the course of the Vietnam War, over 58,000 U.S. troops lost their lives. In addition, more than 300,000 were wounded. To date, more than 1,800 members of the United States Armed Forces remain unaccounted for in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. 
   Those who did return home from Vietnam did not have the traditional welcome home ceremonies. And they continue to face many problems, including health problems related to Agent Orange exposure, prolonged risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and homelessness. Of the 250,000 veterans who are homeless every night, the Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that 47 percent of them served during the Vietnam era. 
   Veterans of the Vietnam War, and all veterans, are entitled to the best care and treatment the U.S. Government can provide. It is important that we honor and respect their service. It is especially important to do so now, at a time when we have so many new veterans returning home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   By honoring those who have served before, we show these new veterans how committed we, as a country, are to them and how much we value the sacrifices they make on our behalf. Establishing a ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'' is one way we can accomplish this. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for her leadership in reaching out to the people of this country, asking them to send in their questions for Judge Roberts. As she noted, 25,000 individuals wrote in questions and we received a total of 40,000 questions. It shows the American people have a lot at stake. This is a serious time for our country, and a very important nomination. We certainly know that. 
   Most Americans understand that the Court plays a huge role in defending our rights and freedoms, and now Judge Roberts has been nominated to be the Chief Justice of the United States. Although some will say it makes no difference, it makes a big difference. The Chief Justice runs the Court, sets its tone, assigns responsibility for writing its decisions, has a certain amount of cachet to speak for the Court, and so on. 
   The Judiciary Committee began its hearings today on Judge Roberts. This is a vital part of the advice and consent role of the Senate. Before we vote, it is every Senator's duty to find out if Judge Roberts will uphold or undermine our fundamental freedoms, the freedoms that essentially define us as Americans. It is our duty to find out if Judge Roberts will fulfill the promise etched above the Court itself: Equal justice under the law--not justice only for the powerful, but equal justice for all. And when I say we have a duty, I am talking about our responsibility as Senators to act on behalf of we the American people. 
   That is why the Democratic women, under Senator Mikulski's leadership, created the AskRoberts Web site. Americans submitted 40,000 questions about a broad range of issues, including privacy, reproductive health, civil rights, women's rights, and the environment. One individual posed this question to Judge Roberts: In your opinion, why would the White House refuse to turn over public records from your time as Deputy Solicitor General? What is there to hide? 
   What is there to hide? It is a very important question. Senators on both sides of the aisle should be asking that question. Before we confirm Judge Roberts to a lifetime appointment as Chief Justice, we need to know everything possible about his views and philosophy. This isn't because it is interesting, because I am sure it would be interesting. Judge Roberts is a very bright and interesting man. But it is because every American's rights and freedoms hang in the balance. Judge Roberts has a very thin record on the bench. Therefore, his writings and statements, when he worked for the Reagan administration and the first Bush administration, become very important. 
   We know that in his position working for Kenneth Starr, Mr. Roberts played a very important role. He was a top decisionmaker in the Solicitor General's Office. He appeared before the Supreme Court and, by his own admission, made the final determination of which cases to appeal in hundreds of circumstances. It is not as if we haven't gotten information like this before. We did so during the confirmation hearings for Judge Bork and Justice Rehnquist. 
   That is why Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, under the leadership of Senator Leahy, and the Democratic leadership, under the leadership of Senator Reid, and the Democratic women, under the leadership of Senator Mikulski, and the entire Democratic caucus have written letter after letter to Attorney General Gonzales demanding these documents be released. 
   We are talking about a very narrow request--only 16 cases--not a broad request for all records. What are these cases we are asking about? They include three about reproductive health, five about discrimination and civil rights, and three about the environment. These are the very issues Americans told us they wanted Roberts to answer questions about when they wrote to our Web site. 
   In poll after poll, the American people are saying that Judge Roberts has to tell us what he believes, and we deserve to have this information. Everyone agrees that Judge Roberts is extremely qualified and very personable. But we need to know about his views and philosophy because, if confirmed, the cases he would decide will impact the daily lives of all Americans. 
   I believe the American people want transparency and openness in this process. This should not be some hide-and-seek, catch-me-if-you-can deal. This is about someone who could sit on the Court for 30 years, or more. This is someone who is going to influence the lives of our grandchildren and perhaps even our great grandchildren. 
   In addition to getting the information on these cases, Judge Roberts also must answer questions, and I hope he is going to do that. I know a couple of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle today seemed to be counseling him not to answer questions. One of them cited Judge Ginsburg, and said she drew the line by refusing to answer questions. 
   Let me tell you what Judge Ginsburg said at her hearing when she was asked about Roe v. Wade and a woman's reproduction freedom. She said:  
   It's a decision she must make for herself.  
   And when Government controls that decision for her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human. 
   That is a quote from Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And it is certainly at odds with all that Senator Hatch and others are saying about how Ruth Bader Ginsburg didn't answer questions about key legal issues. No. 1, her writings on this and other topics were extensive. Then at the hearing, she said clearly that when the Government takes control--I am going to read it again:  
   When Government controls that decision, a woman is being treated as less than a fully adult human.  
   I want to know whether Judge Roberts agrees with that. He will have a chance to express that view and also his view about the role of Congress in protecting our families and communities. Take, for example, the violence against women. Part of that act, written by JOE BIDEN and ORRIN HATCH--and I worked with Senator Biden for years on that--part of that law was thrown out. We want to know how Judge Roberts feels about whether we in the Senate can protect the women of our country, can protect the families of our country, can protect those who perhaps cannot speak for themselves.  
   We need to know if Judge Roberts thinks the right to privacy is a fundamental right. We know he wrote about it as the so-called right of privacy. 
   If I referred to your spouse as your ``so-called spouse,'' that would be an insult, wouldn't it? If I referred to your right to vote as your ``so-called right to vote,'' my constituency would be very upset with me because the right to vote is not a so-called right. So when you say something is a so-called right, it raises a lot of questions about how you feel about it. 
   We also need to know why Judge Roberts argued before the Supreme Court and on national TV that our Federal courts and marshals had no role in stopping clinic violence when women were being threatened and intimidated at family planning clinics all over the country. 
   It is time for Judge Roberts to say what he really thinks--on privacy, on gender discrimination, on civil rights, on the environment. On the appellate court, he wrote an opinion that raises questions about whether he would find the endangered species act constitutional. Does he think it is our right in the Congress to pass environmental laws that protect all Americans? 
   As Senator Mikulski said, the role of the women Senators is very important. Women across America are counting on us to stand up, to ask the questions, and to get the answers. When we vote on this nomination, it must be an informed vote either yes because we believe he will protect our rights and freedoms or no because we have not been convinced. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield back my time to Senator Mikulski.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murray because she has a way of putting things quite succinctly and clearly and I appreciate her coming to the floor. 
   There is a very interesting editorial today in USA Today, and I want to quote from it. The first part says there is no question that the President has chosen someone with similar views to Judge Rehnquist. This is what they say:  
   But, if the men are similar, the nation is different now from what it was when Rehnquist joined the Court 33 years ago, and that difference raises provocative questions for Roberts as Senate confirmation hearings begin today.  
   This is how they say it has changed since Judge Rehnquist's hearings:  
   In particular, the United States has become a far more tolerant society. In 1972, racial segregation was still being dismantled. Women, like African-Americans, were routinely deprived of equal opportunity. The notion that Americans possess a right to privacy, established by the landmark 1965 Supreme Court case that overturned state laws against birth control, was still taking root.  
   This editorial goes on to ask if Roberts would make it difficult for Congress to extend those gains or even turn back the clock, concluding:  
   His record leaves plenty of room for doubt.  
   Now, this is USA Today. It is not considered a liberal newspaper. It is a pretty mainstream paper and it raises the issue of privacy, writing:   
   In memos written when he was in the Reagan administration, Roberts disparaged the notion that there is a constitutional right to privacy that prevents the government from criminalizing contraception, abortion and gay sex.  
   And then it talks about race:  
   Roberts has belittled affirmative action as ``recruiting of inadequately prepared candidates'' and has argued for standards that would make it easier for school districts to evade desegregation orders.  
   On women's rights, it is also troubling:  
   Roberts ridiculed the concept that women are subject to workplace discrimination, and he argued for narrowing the government's ability to enforce the ban on gender discrimination in education.  
   They close by saying:  
   His record bears close scrutiny and his answers should go a long way toward determining whether he should be confirmed for a lifetime appointment as the Nation's most powerful jurist, deciding issues barely imaginable today and influencing the lives of generations to come.  
   As I say, this editorial is quite mainstream. It raises legitimate concerns about Judge Roberts. It basically says to the Senate, it is your job to find out how he is going to rule on cases we cannot even envision at this time. 
   I think that the committee is off to a good start. I received a briefing while I was on a plane today about the Senators' comments on both sides of the aisle. It clearly seems to be a confirmation that both sides are taking extremely seriously. 
   I say to those friends and colleagues on the other side who are counseling Judge Roberts that he does not have to answer questions, that would be a big mistake. The American people in poll after poll are saying to us, we have a right to know. We want to have answers to very important questions that will shed light on if Judge Roberts is going to make sure this Congress and this Federal Government can protect them; that we can protect the environment; equal rights for women and for minorities; that we have the ability to make life better for the American people; and that we, in fact, will be able to respect the dignity of our people by making sure there is not a ``so-called'' right to privacy but a fundamental right to privacy that has been articulated by the Court and that we hope Judge Roberts will uphold. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to 27 young Americans who have been killed in Iraq since February 1. This brings to 550 the number of soldiers who were either from California or based in California who have been killed while serving our country in Iraq. This represents 24 percent of all U.S. deaths in Iraq.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, even though we have all been scattered across the country during this past week as the Senate has been in recess, we have all witnessed through television the devastating scenes from Louisiana and Mississippi. My heart goes out to all of those who have been affected by Hurricane Katrina--those who have lost friends and family members; those who have lost homes; those whose lives have been completely upended. My thoughts and my prayers are with them all. 
   Having represented California in the Senate for the past 12 1/2 years, I have been through my share of disasters--of earthquakes, floods, mudslides, and fires. I know a little of what they are going through right now in the South. But no matter how many disasters I have witnessed first hand in California, I must admit, these are some of the most disturbing and catastrophic scenes I have ever seen. 
   And here we are, several days after the hurricane struck, and it does not appear to be getting much better. Tens of thousands of people remained stranded and trapped--there is a critical lack of food and water--and people are dying. It is truly a desperate situation. 
   So I am pleased to support this legislation to provide emergency funding to help the relief efforts. I doubt it will be enough, and I suspect we will need to do more. I trust that the action we are taking tonight will be just the first step--and will serve to underscore our desire to take care of the people of the Gulf States. 
   The bill (H.R. 3645) was read the third time and passed.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold. I am very proud to be on his resolution which finally would hold this President and his administration accountable for the disastrous situation we find ourselves in in Iraq, a situation that has led to now nearly 2,000 dead, countless wounded, young people and not so young without limbs, without their full brain capacity. It is a stunning failure. 
   Finally, in the Senate, we have a resolution that simply says to this administration: Do tell us, what is your plan? When are we getting out? Give us the milestones. And, what is the mission? 
   I have a couple of questions I wanted to ask my friend. As my friend was talking, I wrote down the various missions that we have heard from the administration that we were supposed to have in Iraq. The first one was weapons of mass destruction. Remember when Secretary Rumsfeld said: I know where they are; I could point to where they are. No, there weren't any. Then they said: We have to get Saddam. He is a tyrant. We all agreed, he is a tyrant. Saddam is gone for all intents and purposes. That was the second mission. Then they said: We are going to rebuild Iraq, a disastrous situation over which Secretary Rice is in charge. I haven't seen much rebuilding. I have seen a lot of no-bid contracts. Then they said: We have to have an election. That is the next mission. They had an election. After that, everything fell apart. Then they said: We need to bring security. We are going to train the Iraqi forces. The Senator from Wisconsin and I agree with that. We want to see them trained--it seems to be taking forever--especially when we have the President saying: We will stay there as long as it takes. What kind of message is that to the Iraqis? 
   We had a briefing yesterday. We can't discuss the details of that briefing, but it seemed to me there were yet other missions laid out. 
   I ask my friend, does he see the situation the way I do: An ever-changing mission in Iraq, setting the bar higher and higher with no end in sight is where we are at the present time?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague for correcting me on the point that I missed that, yes, out of the five or six missions I named, I left out the very important one that he corrected me on, which is that there was a link between Saddam and al-Qaida and, in fact, there was al-Qaida all over Iraq. 
   The Senator and I sit on the Foreign Relations 
   Committee. I think he remembers this document that I put into the RECORD, because I remember he very much wanted it, which showed that about a month after September 11 when we were so viciously attacked by bin Laden--who, by the way, we were going to get dead or alive, and we need to do that--the fact is, the State Department in its own document said there wasn't one al-Qaida cell, not one, in Iraq. There were more cells in America than in Iraq, according to our own State Department. We have put that in the RECORD. 
   Now, of course, it is a haven for terrorism because of this failed policy, this disastrous policy, this policy that is utter chaos with no end in sight, unless the Senate and the administration look at what my friend put forward, which is finally saying to the President: You need a mission, a mission that can be accomplished, and we need to end this in an orderly fashion. 
   I wanted to ask my friend one more point, and then I will leave the Chamber. That is about the National Guard. Right now, there are fires raging in my home State, sadly. We have them every year at this time. It is heartwrenching. We need all the help we can get. We always get all the help we ask for. We have never had a problem. The National Guard is called out when it gets really out of control. 
   Is my friend aware that the best equipment that the National Guard had at its disposal is in Iraq, not here at home? And when the people were crying out for help, not only were so many of the National Guard over in Iraq, my understanding is--and my friend can correct me--approximately 40 percent of our troops over there are National Guard. That is my information. Not only that, the best equipment of the National Guard is over in Iraq. 
   Don't our people deserve better than that so when they experience disasters, our National Guard can respond?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of the late LCDR Frank Carl Wittwer. Lieutenant Commander Wittwer, a longtime Hanford resident, perished when his F/A-18C Hornet went down during a training mission near Naval Air Facility El Centro on January 18, 2006. He was 35 years old. 
   A 1994 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer was fondly remembered as a friendly and active student who participated in a number of activities such as music and youth ministries at his church. Upon receiving his bachelor of science degree in systems engineering, he began his successful active-duty career as a surface warfare officer aboard the USS California and the USS McFaul. 
   In recognition of his considerable talents, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer was assigned to the Hornet Program with VFA-137 in 2001. Subsequently, he received postings at Strike Fighter Wing Pacific Fleet as safety officer and a follow-on assignment with the VFA-97 Warhawks. Throughout his years of service, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer was known as a dedicated and honorable serviceman who embodied the best qualities and ideals of the U.S. Navy. 
   In his personal life, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer demonstrated a genuine commitment to improving the lives of others. A popular figure in the community and an elder in the First Presbyterian Church in Hanford, he had a passion in working with kindergartners and grade school students. A man of many talents, Lieutenant Commander Wittwer recently completed the executive MBA program at the California State University, Fresno's Craig School of Business. 
   Lieutenant Commander Wittwer will be remembered by those whose lives he touched as a devoted family man, a loyal friend and an outstanding member of the U.S. Navy. He is survived by his wife Mendi; daughters Erin and Abbie; son Jack; sister Patti; nephew Josh; and his grandfather Hurdis Harris.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the inspired life of an American icon, Rosa Parks, who died on Monday, October 24, 2005 in Detroit, MI, at the age of 92. 
   Rosa Parks is often called the ``Mother of the Civil Rights Movement'' because of her courage in refusing to give up her seat in the black section of a Montgomery, AL, bus to a white man. Her refusal to tolerate racial prejudice paved the way for the civil rights gains that followed. 
   On December 1, 1955, Parks was a tired seamstress on her way home from work, sitting at the front of the section reserved for black bus riders. When the bus started to fill up, Parks refused to give up her seat after the bus driver demanded she move despite the fact that three fellow black people moved from their seats. 
   Parks was arrested and fined $14.00 for disorderly conduct and violating a city ordinance. Parks' family was harassed after the bus incident and she was fired from her job as a seamstress. 
   To protest Parks' arrest and bus segregation, the African American community formed the Montgomery Improvement Association, headed by the  young minister of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The group organized a successful 381-day boycott of the bus system during which time African Americans in Montgomery walked, took taxicabs and formed carpools. The boycott took quite a toll on the finances of the bus system and provided a model for successful nonviolent resistance against racism in the U.S. 
   The boycott ended on November 13, 1956, after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that Montgomery's segregated bus system was unconstitutional. However, it wasn't until the 1964 Civil Rights Act that all public places in the U.S. were desegregated. 
   Of her refusal to move, Parks said, ``I only knew that, as I was being arrested, that it was the very last time that I would ever ride in humiliation of this kind.'' 
   Rosa Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley in Tuskegee, AL, on February 4, 1913, to James McCauley, a carpenter, and Leona Edwards McCauley, a teacher. In 1932, at the age of 20, she married Raymond Parks, a barber, and they remained married until his death in 1977. She attended Alabama State College, worked as a seamstress and housekeeper, and was active in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP, and the Montgomery Voters League to register and empower black voters. In 1943 she was elected Secretary of the Montgomery Chapter of the NAACP. 
   In 1957 she and her husband moved to Detroit, MI, where they remained active in the NAACP and the Southern Christian, Leadership Conference, SCLC. In 1965, she went to work for Congressman John Conyers, Jr., a civil rights leader, managing his Detroit office. 
   In 1987, in honor of her husband, she founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development in order to motivate youth to reach their full potential through the philosophy of ``Quiet Strength.'' 
   Parks remained active into her 80s, speaking to civil rights groups and accepting awards, including the Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. 
   I had the honor and privilege of meeting this incredible woman in the 1990s. She was dignified, brave and an inspiration to me and generations of Americans who care about equality, freedom and human dignity. Parks said it best in the following statement: ``To this day I believe we are here on the planet Earth to live, grow up and do what we can to make this world a better place for all people to enjoy freedom.'' 
   Rosa Parks showed us that one person can change history and make a difference by taking a principled stand against injustice. Her legacy also teaches us that we must fight against continued inequality in America and around the world. We must never give up.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have all seen the unprecedented destruction and suffering caused by Hurricane Katrina. 
   With the Katrina disaster, tens of thousands of people in the Gulf States have lost their jobs. In fact, over 200,000 have filed for unemployment benefits. For that reason, I introduced the Hurricane Katrina Reconstruction and Displaced Workers Assistance Act of 2005. This legislation would give priority in awarding Federal contracts for the rebuilding efforts to those companies where workers displaced by Hurricane Katrina comprise at least 25 percent of the workforce fulfilling the contract. It is the least we could do to help displaced workers. 
   Unfortunately, on the same day I introduced my bill to help workers, President Bush did just the opposite. He issued a proclamation saying that those who get Federal contracts for rebuilding will not have to pay workers the prevailing wage. This is unfair to working men and women. It is not right. The tragedy of Hurricane Katrina should not be used as an excuse to take advantage of working people. 
   Therefore, to ensure that workers in the region affected by the hurricane are paid the region's prevailing wages, I am introducing a second version of the Hurricane Katrina Reconstruction and Displaced Worker Assistance Act of 2005. It will still give priority to those companies who hire displaced workers, but it will also ensure that all workers are paid the prevailing wage. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Erma Ora Byrd, the wife of our esteemed colleague, ROBERT C. BYRD of West Virginia. It has always warmed my heart to watch the Senator from West Virginia speak of his wife in conversation, of which we have had many, or as he has stood on this Senate floor. He has mentioned her name, and whenever he mentioned it, he immediately got this glow on his face in reverence to his friend, his wife, his love of nearly seven decades. 
   Love of this magnitude should be celebrated. And their marriage of 69 years should be celebrated. As a matter of fact, recently I talked to Senator Byrd about his marriage, and he said: I just hope that we can celebrate 70 years of marriage. Well, they did not get to 70 years. They got to 69, plus. And although her body failed her this past weekend, and their time together on this Earth ended, the love they shared--Senator Byrd and Erma--that love is timeless and that love is forever.

This brings to 508 the number of soldiers who were either from California or based in California who have been killed while serving our country in Iraq. This represents 24 percent of all U.S. deaths in Iraq. 
   LCpl Jeremy P. Tamburello, 19, died November 8 from wounds sustained from an improvised explosive device while conducting combat operations west of Rutbah. He was assigned to the 1st Light Armor Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Marine Division, Camp Pendleton, CA. 
   LCpl David A. Mendez Ruiz, 20 died November 12 from an improvised explosive device while conducting combat operations against enemy forces in Al Amiriyah. He was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Twentynine Palms, CA. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, his unit was attached to the 2nd Marine Division. 
   LCpl Scott A. Zubowski, 20, died November 12 from an improvised explosive device while conducting combat operations against enemy forces in Al Amiriyah. He was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, Twentynine Palms, CA. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, his unit was attached to the 2nd Marine Division.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I had asked for an hour to speak for the RECORD on a number of issues. First, I will pay tribute to 53 young Americans who have been killed in Iraq since December 7, 2004. This brings to 402 the number of soldiers who were either from California or based in California that have been killed while serving our country. I want to make the point to my colleagues this represents 26 percent of all the military deaths in Iraq. Twenty-six percent of those deaths have come from California, either the person was born and raised in California or was stationed in California. We continue to mourn those losses. As I have promised since the day the war started, I will pay tribute to them by name so they are not forgotten.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a special day for all of us who are on the floor presently because this date has been coming, in my opinion, for far too long. We could have done this 4 years ago, but sometimes it takes a while for good things to happen. 
   We will not look back, we will look ahead. 
   I say to my colleague, Senator Feinstein, that we are very fortunate because we worked hard to set up a system for our district court nominees which is working beautifully. We don't have rancor in California over judges--we really don't. 
   This nomination of Milan Smith is also an opportunity to bring everyone together around a fine man, someone who will be, I believe, a very fine judge. Why? Because Mr. Smith is highly respected by those who know him and know his work. I am confident he will discharge his responsibilities with dignity, integrity, and intelligence. 
   After law school, Mr. Smith joined the firm of O'Melveny & Myers and later started his own law firm where he is the managing partner. His work in the private sector has given him a wealth of experience and has earned him respect from his peers. 
   Mr. Smith's career goes beyond the private practice of law. He has dedicated a significant amount of time and energy to public service, as well. In 1984, then-Governor Deukmejian appointed Mr. Smith to the governing board of the Los Angeles Service Building Authority where he served as president until 1992. Since then, he has acted as the Authority's general counsel. 
   He also was appointed as a member of the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission. He joined the Fair Employment and Housing Commission in 1988 and worked for the next 3 years to protect the rights of the disadvantaged. It says a lot about Milan Smith. This was something he wanted to do: protect the rights of others who are less fortunate than he. 
   During that tenure, Mr. Smith worked with legislators to reverse a Supreme Court of California decision limiting the commission's power to reward and collect damages for victims of discrimination. Because of Mr. Smith's hard work, passion, and compassion, the California Legislature passed a bill restoring the commission's authority to award damages to victims of discrimination. 
   When then-Governor Wilson vetoed the bill, Mr. Smith resigned in protest. We all know a lot of fine people, but it takes guts to stand up and say: I submit my resignation. That shows courage and independence of mind. Here is Milan Smith, standing up to a Governor of the same political party. That is hard to do. I am sure it was painful. I am sure it was terrible. But he did it. 
   In his resignation letter, Mr. Smith said:  
   Despite my generally conservative political views, I've come to know much more of the sexual harassment, bigotry and mean spiritedness abroad in the land. To continue to sit on the FEHC when we can do nothing to fairly compensate genuine victims of unlawful sexual harassment, for example, would be unconscionable to me.  
   Again, those words are eloquent. They are courageous. They show the kind of leadership we need in a judge. We need someone who is fair, someone who truly understands the rights of all Americans, and certainly of all Californians. Mr. Smith gained my profound respect by refusing to sit quietly in the face of what he believed to be injustice. It gives me confidence that as judges sit around and discuss cases that have come before them, he will be motivated by a fierce sense of independence. He will not fear standing up and will be counted when the moment comes. 
   I am absolutely thrilled about this nomination. The Ninth Circuit will benefit greatly with the addition of Milan Smith. I strongly support his nomination. I had written a letter in favor of this nominee 4, maybe more, 5 years ago. This is a wonderful day for me, personally. I know Senator Feinstein feels that way. My colleague feels that way, and I think most of our colleagues feel this way. It shows we can reach across party lines and come to a point where we can compromise. I am sure Mr. Smith isn't going to do everything I want or everything that Senator Frist wants, but this is a wonderful choice today. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator Feinstein to introduce a bill authorizing the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior to make grants to facilitate the establishment of the National Ag Science Center in Stanislaus County, California. This bill will create a facility that will help teach visitors from all across the country about the significance of agriculture in our Nation's culture and economy, the importance of science in agriculture, and California's role as the Nation's preeminent agricultural State. 
   This bill will designate $10 million in total grant funding to help fund construction costs of the center, with the  federal share limited to 33 percent of the total cost. I am happy to report that the center is making great progress on raising private donations to complete its share of the construction funding. 
   The center will help promote California's place as the Nation's most diverse and productive agricultural State. With the farmers, growers, and ranchers of our State producing over 350 different crops and commodities, and nearly 80,000 active farming operations, agriculture is one of California's most important industries. From our vineyards and wineries, to the almond, stone fruit, strawberry, cotton, and rice farms, to the citrus groves of central and southern California, to the dairy and cattle ranches across the State, farming and agriculture are ubiquitous in California and impact all of our communities in an important way. 
   The farms, large and small, produce half of America's produce and are exported all across the globe, providing billions of dollars to our economy and balance of trade. 
   The center's mission will place an emphasis on agricultural science education, with interactive, high-technology exhibits designed to foster an understanding of the importance of agriculture, and how science plays an essential role in the farm-to-food process. There will also be a strong focus on highlighting the important relationship between agriculture, conservation, and the environment. 
   I would also like to thank Representatives CARDOZA, MATSUI and RADANOVICH for introducing a companion bill in the House of Representatives.

   Mrs. BOXER. What I want to say, before my friend from Iowa leaves, thank you so much, Senator Harkin. I think what you addressed in your remarks is something that has been missing from this debate, and that is what the people are telling us back home. They, in my opinion, do not want to see the filibuster go away because they understand it is a very important part of the American fabric of politics for more than 200 years. 
   They also understand, without a doubt, that the issues that concern their everyday lives are just not being addressed. My friend laid them out beautifully. 
   In Iowa, CA, our people are feeling the same things. They are struggling with high gas prices, lack of health care, worried about the cost of health care, and education. They are absolutely frightened about the President's attack on Social Security. They want us to fight back. They want us to solve the Social Security long-range problem without reducing benefits, without taking away Social Security, and not turning Social Security into a guaranteed gamble. These are issues that are key. Transportation is another issue my friend mentioned. I thank Senator Harkin for his contribution tonight. 
   I also thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who took this Senate back from a cliff where there were very treacherous waters below. They turned us away from a power grab by the majority, from a move that was clearly an abuse of power. They called it themselves, those who wanted this option, the nuclear option. They were right to call it the nuclear option because it would have been so devastating, not only to the Senate, not only to the people of this country, but to the foundation of our Republic--the checks and balances which were put into this system by our brilliant Founders who came together. As Senator Byrd reminded us tonight that Benjamin Franklin said: ``I've given you a Republic, if you can keep it.'' 
   That is the key. Can we keep the Republic? We do not keep a representative democracy such as this if we allow one side, whichever side that is, to trample upon the rights of the other. What happens is you wind up trampling on the rights of the American people themselves. 
   The other day I was making a mental note of who supported the nuclear option, taking away the right of any Senator to filibuster a judicial nominee, who in this body supported that, versus those who thought it ought to be sustained and we ought to have that right. When we add up the number of people we represent on each side, the senators on the side that wanted to keep the filibuster represented far more people, millions more people. So this was a moment in time when the rights of so many of those people would have been taken away, just as the rights of their Senators would be taken away. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues on both sides who worked so hard to bring us back from this abuse of power. I hope that it means forever. I personally hope we never hear the words ``nuclear option'' again. It would be best for this country if we allowed the 200-year history plus of this country to sustain us. 
   The filibuster started in 1806. This is the filibuster's 200th year. It has been used sparingly. Let's look at how many times we have blocked President Bush's judges. I hope I don't have to bring this chart out again. I hope we  are done with this. But for tonight we need to summarize where we have been. 
   Mr. President, 208 to 10 is what caused all the angst by the Republicans. They wanted to take away our right to block 5 percent of George Bush's judges. As I have said at home in many meetings, if any one of you got 95 percent of what you wanted in your life, you would be smiling. I would be--unless I wanted everything and I thought I knew best and I was the smartest. We all go through those times when we think that way but one would hope at this point when we get here, after working a little bit here in the Senate--and I admit I didn't see it right in the beginning--we come to respect rights of the minority. The filibuster has been used rarely. 
   I also want to discuss what I call the filibuster fantasy world that cropped up in these debates. I will show a chart I was going to use in the debate which, thankfully, we do not have to have. But for the purposes of history, we ought to look at what was shaping up. 
   First of all, every day we came to the Senate we heard Republicans say: The Democrats started the filibusters on judges. That is funny, in a way, because the opposite is true. In modern times, the use of the filibuster began with Abe Fortas in the 1960s. I looked at a headline in the Washington Post from the 1960s. It said: ``Filibuster Launched Against Fortas.'' This was President Johnson's, a Democrat, nominee to the Supreme Court. The first paragraph of that Post article said:  
   The Republicans launched an all-out filibuster against Abe Fortas.  
   That is a fact. The filibuster fantasy says that Democrats started the filibusters on judges. 
   The second fantasy we have heard repeatedly recently from Republicans is Republicans have never filibustered judges. 
   That one I can state from personal experience does not hold up--I don't have to rely on newspapers; I don't have to rely on hearsay; I don't have to rely on folk tales. I was here and I saw the Republican filibuster against two terrific people from California, Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez. Guess what? That was not in the 1800s or the 1960s. It was the year 2000. And do Members know who voted to continue to filibuster Richard Paez? BILL FRIST, the good doctor, who says he wants to take away our rights. Tonight he says he is backing off. He has no choice but to back off because, luckily, we had enough people from both sides of the aisle to pull us back from this precipice. BILL FRIST himself filibustered Richard Paez. Pretty amazing for him to say that we should never filibuster when he filibustered, when his Republican colleagues are on the record saying they were proud to filibuster and it is their constitutional right to filibuster. 
   So you can't rewrite the record book. We have a Congressional Record. We had a vote to end the filibuster on Richard Paez, a wonderful candidate put 
   up by President Clinton. BILL FRIST voted to filibuster that man. Yet he says if we Democrats vote to filibuster somebody, and I am quoting him, ``we are behaving badly.'' He said that four times tonight. Bad behavior. 
   This is not a kindergarten class. This is not even high school. This is the Senate. When I decide to filibuster a judge, which is my prerogative, and will remain so, I am happy to say under this good agreement, I am not behaving badly, I am behaving as a Senator who has looked at this nominee, who has seen that this nominee is dangerous to America, who has seen that this nominee is extremist and will hurt the American families who I represent. Am I not behaving as a Senator? No, I am not behaving badly. 
   Let's look at the other Republican filibuster fantasies. They say all judges should get an up-or-down vote. Do you know how many votes Priscilla Owen had so far? Four. She is about to have the fifth. Janice Rogers Brown has had one. Clinton judges, 61 of them, most of them never made it out of committee. Most of them were pocket filibustered. They never had an up-or-down vote. Every one of George Bush's nominees have had an up-or-down vote. They may not have made the 60 votes they needed to make because for 200 years-plus the Senate has had the right for extended debate. These people could not get the 60 votes. 
   Why couldn't they get 60 votes? Because these nominees are so extreme. I will talk about one of them in a minute and tell Members why because it is an extraordinary circumstance. The President sent down a nominee who is out of the mainstream. 
   First, I want to tell you a story about ORRIN HATCH who was the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee for a time when Bill Clinton was President. ORRIN HATCH called me into his office and he said: Senator Boxer, if you want to get a vote on a judge from California, don't send me anyone from the liberal side. Send me mainstream judges, Senator. Send me mainstream judges and we will be OK. We had a great chat. 
   I said: Well, I am not so sure; maybe sometimes you want to have someone a little more liberal. 
   He said: Don't discuss it with me. Mainstream judges. That's it. 
   So for ORRIN HATCH, when Bill Clinton was President, he had a litmus test. Mainstream judges. I didn't think it was that unreasonable. Where is the litmus test now on mainstream judges? It has gone out the windows. 
   Alberto Gonzales himself said that Priscilla Owen's opinions were ``unconscionable judicial activism''. So we say to the President of the United States of America: Do what Bill Clinton did, send us mainstream judges and we do not have any problem with that. We will walk down this aisle proudly. Frankly, we did it 208 times. I am not sure this President has any cause for alarm. He got 95 percent of his judges, but he wants it all, after all, he is George Bush. We had a King George. We had a king. Now we want a President of all the people. We do not want a king. We want him to govern. We do not want him to rule. There is a difference. 
   This wonderful agreement sustains our right in the future to step out if each of us determines there is a reason to filibuster. 
   Now, again, the filibuster fantasy is that Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown have never had a vote in the Senate. I have already stated, they just cannot make the 60-vote cut because they are so out of the mainstream. 
   Then there is this issue the Republicans have now said they want to change from the nuclear option to the constitutional option. Nothing in the Constitution prohibits filibusters. We know that. The Constitution says the Senate shall writes its own rules, which brings me to another point. 
   Here is something I want the American people to know. I want my colleagues to understand. The Constitution says the Senate shall write its own rules, and Rule XXII of the Senate says if you want to change a rule of the Senate, folks, you have to get 67 votes to move to change the rules. It is important to do this when you change the rules of the Senate. The Constitution says we shall write our own rules. But the Senate rules do not envision a small group of Senators changing the rules. It ensures that a large group of Senators must approve of changing the Senate rules. If you have to change the rules, this is what you have to have 67 votes to close off debate for a rule change. 
   Guess what? My Republican friends who brought us the nuclear option knew they could not get 67 votes to destroy the system of checks and balances, to change our government as we have known it for so many years. They could not get 67 votes, not even close. They even had to have DICK CHENEY in the chair for this vote, folks, because it could be that close; 51, maybe. What do they do? How are they going to get around the rules of the Senate? Well, not to worry about the rules of the Senate. We will make a precedent. 
   The Parliamentarian will say that Senators have a right to filibuster, absolutely. The Parliamentarian will say we need 67 votes to change the rules of the Senate, but DICK CHENEY, sitting in the chair as a rubberstamp for this administration, as part of it, will say: I disagree with the Parliamentarian. We can change this right now by declaring by fiat no more filibusters of judges ever again. 
   That is the new precedent. 
   I would ask my friends, what kind of an example is this to set for our children? Let's say our children go to school, and they know to get an 80 percent on a test is a B, and they get a 75 percent. Let's say they then go to their teacher and say: Oh, I got a 75 percent,  and I don't want to come home with a C. Can you just change the rules today for me and make it an A? Change the rules. Or if you are serving on a jury, and everyone has to agree on the guilt of someone, but, oh, they decide on this day, only 9 of the 12 have to agree. 
   I could go on and on with examples like this. The fact is, it is a terrible precedent for our children to see grown people in the Senate change more than 200 years of Senate history by going around the rules of the Senate. 
   I was here when I was just a freshman. I was annoyed with the filibuster. I was really annoyed. The Republicans were filibustering all the time. I thought it was terrible. One of my colleagues said: Let's change the rules. 
   I said: Great. I think President Clinton ought to get his whole agenda through. I am tired of hearing about what I don't agree with. 
   I was wrong. I did not know I was wrong. I was wrong. But one thing I did, I did not try to do it with some slipshod, fake precedent change. I tried to do it by getting 67 votes. We did not even come near 20 because it is a losing proposition. 
   The nuclear option would have been a disaster. And I have to tell you, out in the countryside, the polling is showing that the people are sick of this place. They do not understand what we are doing. We are irrelevant to them. And indeed it is no wonder we are viewed this way given all the effort we have expended on this nuclear option business. It simply fits into what the people have been saying for a while, that we just do not get it. 
   They are paying these gas prices at the pump, and what are we doing? Nothing. The President could release some strategic petroleum reserves. Oh, no, the first President in modern times never to do that. And, yes, gas is going down a few pennies, I am happy about that. But, believe you me, it is not going down far enough. What are we doing about that? Nothing that I could see. No, no, we are wasting our time on the nuclear option because the President wanted 100 percent of what he asked for. He did not want 95 percent. He wanted 100 percent of his judges. 
   Another President once tried to pack the courts, and his name was Franklin Roosevelt, a great Democratic President. Do you know what? When Franklin Roosevelt was in office, there were 74 Democrats in the Senate. Franklin Roosevelt was annoyed. He wanted 100 percent. He got 60 percent in the election, a lot more than this President did. He had 74 Democratic Senators. And he wanted to pack the courts. He wanted to double the number of Supreme Court Justices, put his people in play, have the Democrats in the Senate rubberstamp and make sure that his New Deal would live forever more. 
   Do you know what stopped him? Democratic Senators. They said: Mr. President, we admire you. We respect you. But we know it is wrong to pack the courts. It is not right. We want an independent judiciary. Let us not change the rules in the middle of the game. 
   I was so hopeful that we would have some Republican Senators this time who had a sense of history, who understood better than I did when I was new here that the filibuster protects not only the minority but protects the American people. 
   I want to explain to you, in my final moments, why it is so important that we keep the filibuster. In this deal, three judges are going to go through, are going to have a simple majority vote. One of them is Janice Rogers Brown. Now, I am not thrilled about this because I think her record is so far out of the mainstream that she will hurt the American people. But I do not want to just put out rhetoric. I want to show you Janice Rogers Brown and some of the times in which Janice Rogers Brown, as a judge on the California Supreme Court, stood alone in her dissents. So when you ask me: Senator Boxer, why is it that you filibustered Janice Rogers Brown--and, by the way, I support this deal. Even though she will only need 51 votes, I still support the deal. But I have to tell you, I am going to fight to deprive her of those 51 votes, if I can. She stood alone on a court of six Republicans and one Democrat. She is a Republican. She stood alone 31 times because the court was not rightwing enough for her. 
   Let's look at some of the times Janice Rogers Brown stood alone, how way out of the mainstream to the extreme she is. 
   She said a manager could use racial slurs against his Latino employees. Can you imagine a decision like that? It is OK to use racial slurs against Latino employees. Janice Rogers Brown said that in Aguilar v. Avis Rental Car. 
   She is bad on first amendment rights. She argued that a message sent by an employee to coworkers criticizing a company's employment practices was not protected by the free speech first amendment, but she has been very protective of corporate speech. So she walks away from the individual but supports the right of corporate speech. 
   If you want individual rights protected, this is not your person. Here is one: She protects companies, not shareholders. 
   She is bad for rape victims. She was the only member of the court to vote to overturn the conviction of the rapist of a 17-year-old girl because she believed the victim gave mixed messages to the rapist. 
   Now, I just want to say something here. Every one of us here would come to the defense of a 17-year-old rape victim. And on a court of six Republicans and one Democrat, only one person stood alone, stood by the rapist, Janice Rogers Brown. So when I say I do not want her to be promoted, you can see why. 
   Janice Rogers Brown is bad for children and 
   families. She was the only member of the court to oppose an effort to stop the sale of cigarettes to children. Now, I do not know how you all feel about this, but this is 2005, and we know what an addiction to cigarettes can be. We do not want our kids being able to purchase cigarettes in stores. Janice Rogers Brown stood alone in Stop Youth Addiction v. Lucky Stores. She stood alone on a court of six Republicans, one Democrat. She stood alone and would not protect our children from the sale of tobacco. 
   Senior citizens: the only member of the court to find that a 60-year-old woman who was fired from her hospital job could not sue. This is what she said in this dissent, where she stood alone on a court of six Republicans and one Democrat. She said:  
   Discrimination based on age does not mark its victims with a stigma of inferiority and second class citizenship.  
   Really? Really? A 60-year-old woman was fired from her hospital job on age discrimination. State and Federal law prohibit age discrimination. Janice Rogers Brown stood alone and said there is no stigma. Someone fires you because you are old, and there is no stigma. 
   But that is the least of it. Janice Rogers Brown----

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, I say to my friend from Alabama. 
   Janice Rogers Brown has an attitude toward seniors which is extraordinary. She calls senior citizens cannibals. She says they are militant and they cannibalize their grandchildren by getting free stuff from the Government. I have to tell you, this woman is so far out of the mainstream, this is just a touch of the debate that is to hit the Senate floor. 
   So when we stand up as Democrats and say no to Janice Rogers Brown, we have a reason. It is not about the Senate. It is not about partisanship. It is about the American people and the American family. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank those Senators on both sides of the aisle for bringing us back from this precipice. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator heard me speak, I spoke quite a while about that. I said how wrong I was, how green I was, how I was frustrated with the Republicans blocking things. And I was dead wrong. I also said that what we tried to do is change the rules, which takes 67 votes. We did not go in the dead of night to try and get it done. So, yes, the Senator is right. I was dead wrong. Tough to admit that, but I have been very open about that since the beginning of the debate.

   Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise today with a heavy heart. We have all watched in horror as the Gulf Coast has been struck by what could be called the worst natural disaster in our history. 
   Over the weekend, Chief Justice Rehnquist, who served our Court and country with such distinction for 33 years, and showed such bravery in the last months of his life, passed away. 
   We have now lost nearly 2,000 young men and women in Iraq, and we still do not have, in my opinion, a credible plan, a mission, a timetable to achieve success and bring our troops home. Gas prices are putting horrible strains on most Americans. 
   There is a tremendous amount of anxiety in America today. I feel it when I go home to California. We must confront it immediately in the Senate, in the House, and, yes, at the White House. 
   With one party controlling the entire Government, there is pressure in some quarters to be silent and just let mistakes and misplaced priorities take their toll. 
   Well, I do not agree with that mindset. I am going to say what I think. And even more important, I am going to do everything I can with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help get our country moving in the right direction again. 
   Lives hang in the balance in this disaster and, God forbid, in the next one. It is difficult to put into words how heartbroken we all are for Americans affected by Hurricane Katrina. Thousands of people have lost their lives. Far more have lost their homes, their jobs, their communities. Brave souls everywhere are still searching for some family members while trying to keep others alive and hopeful. 
   I even heard a doctor on CNN talking about being forced to make the impossible choice of whom to save and whom to leave behind to die. 
   Yes, the acts of bravery are being celebrated, as they should be--neighbor helping neighbor, churches filling in for FEMA, local law enforcement putting their own hardships aside to work 24 hours a day helping others. 
   But there are images, such as this one I show here, that leave us in tears. It shows a makeshift grave along the road--a makeshift grave. Somebody put a sheet over a body, and it looks  like bricks are holding down the sheet. There is a cross on top, and it says: ``Here lies Vera. God help us.'' God help us, indeed. How can this have happened in America? Here we are, the most powerful and prosperous country in the world, and our people have to write notes on handmade graves to get attention. 
   Well, words of compassion are not enough. We must show those who have suffered so much that their Government will help them find their missing relatives, and rebuild their lives, homes, and communities. 
   The $10.5 billion we appropriated was an important start but just a start. We should not wait another day to give all the victims of Katrina immediate access to Medicaid or to exempt them from the recent bankruptcy law. We should not be cutting Medicaid now, and that is exactly what is in the budget bill the Republicans are bringing before us. 
   We should not wait another day to provide temporary housing for all those displaced, including emergency vouchers. We also should use our military bases that are vacant to house people until they are on their feet again. 
   We should not wait another day to make sure that Halliburton, or any other company receiving Federal contracts, employs some of the estimated 500,000 to 1 million people who are now jobless. Put them to work rebuilding their own communities. You are giving these companies Federal contracts. Let them step to the plate and do their share. There are two similarities that I see between Iraq and this hurricane. The administration did not have a plan for either, and Halliburton will end up making billions of dollars for both. 
   Hurricane Katrina has shown a spotlight on the best and the worst of America. We have seen the inspiring courage of the survivors and the dedicated men and women working around the clock to help them. We have also seen those who would loot, and take advantage of this tragic situation. We have seen the heroics of the press, which put a spotlight on the full extent of the tragedy. 
   We have also seen the deadly chasm between the haves and the have-nots, with the poorest among us left behind, literally and figuratively, to weather the storm. And, yes, we have seen, in my opinion, an unacceptable response from our Federal Government. The President himself said that, and then he backed away. 
   I know the President has said he will launch an investigation, but it is not sufficient for the President to investigate his own administration. Congress must fulfill its oversight responsibility. I thank Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman for pledging to hold hearings on the Government's response to this tragedy. 
   Today, an AP wire story that was just handed to me says, ``The top U.S. disaster official''--that is Michael Brown--``waited hours after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast before he proposed to his boss,'' that is Michael Chertoff, ``sending at least 1,000 Homeland Security workers into the region to support rescuers, internal documents show.'' 
   Quoting further the AP wire story:  
   The same day Brown wrote Chertoff, Brown also urged local fire and rescue departments outside Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi not to send trucks or emergency workers into disaster areas without an explicit request for help from state or local governments.  
   We must fulfill our oversight responsibility. I agree with Senator Clinton that we should also create an independent Katrina commission. Hurricane Katrina 
   has raised alarming questions about our Nation's ability to prepare for and respond to disasters. 
   Last Thursday, the President told Diane Sawyer that we did anticipate a serious storm, and I quote him:  
   I don't think anyone anticipated the breach of the levees.  
   Well, that is unbelievable. All you had to do was look at FEMA's own report in 2001, which listed the three most likely catastrophic disasters our country could face. What were they? A massive earthquake in California, a terrorist attack on New York City, and a major hurricane hitting New Orleans. All you had to do was look at the Houston Chronicle, which predicted this. The New Orleans Times-Picayune predicted this. The National Geographic predicted this. There was a 5-day simulation in July of 2004 to specifically address a disastrous hurricane in New Orleans. The LA Times reported that in late May the Army Corps of Engineers in the New Orleans district formally notified Washington that hurricane storm surges could knock out two of the big pumping stations that keep the city dry. 
   On the day before the tragedy struck, an AP wire story said:  
   Experts expect Katrina to turn New Orleans into Atlantis, leaving up to 1 million homeless.  
   They did not think the levees would break? 
   And what about the budgets? Despite repeated requests from New Orleans for more Federal money to protect the city, the press reported that funding for Corps of Engineers projects in the New Orleans area fell by 44 percent between 2001 and 2005. This is unacceptable. 
   Michael Brown should go. He is a nice man. But I agree with Senator Mikulski, he should go. He should go because he does not even have the experience to do this job. He was the head of an Arabian horsemen's association. That is not training to step into a disaster the size of the one we have seen. 
   Now, in California, we know how important FEMA is during a disaster. After the Northridge Earthquake, James Lee Witt, the head of FEMA, was out there. We counted on him, and Lord knows how many lives he saved. He knew what he was doing. We built up FEMA during that time, all of us working together. It has now been turned into a shadow of its former self. 
   I also agree we ought to make FEMA again an independent agency. Senator Byrd tried to do that. He offered an amendment that said: Let's wait before we put FEMA under Homeland Security. Twenty-eight of us voted for that. It did not pass. I warned at that time very clearly that this was making me extremely nervous. My quote was:  
   Putting the Federal Emergency Management Administration, [FEMA] lock, stock, and barrel, into this new Department I just think is going to be a real problem for us. ..... I am very worried about accountability.  
   Now, I do not say this to imply that I knew what was going to happen. I did not. But I do have some common sense, and I know you need one person in charge who has the ability, yes, to move mountains. 
   Yesterday, we had a briefing on this up in room 407. We had the whole Cabinet there. I listened to a lot of good people. I would have preferred one person I could hold accountable. 
   There are many more things I am going to do. But I have to say this: For years we tried to get interoperable communications funding--for years. I had a bill. Senator Stabenow had a bill. It got through the Senate. It got taken out by the House. We still do not have emergency workers able to talk to one another. 
   So we need to move fast. We need to move fast before the next disaster strikes. Now, we all pray in the Senate we will not have another disaster like this, but we must plan in case we do. That is our job. That is our work. We must set aside a lot of other things we are going to do around here to get this right because we know we are living under the threat of a terrorist attack that could occur in any city in this country. And this is a sad case for us and not one that should be emulated. 
   We all have to move forward. And, yes, the people who did not do the right thing should not be heading these agencies. In my state of California, we know how it feels to lose your bearings, your home, and your sense of security. I saw it so many times in my congressional career, in my Senate career. Earthquakes, fires, floods, mud slides; you name it, we have had it. You need strength at the Federal Government level when these things happen. Look at the city of New Orleans, what they tried to do with the police officers. Two police officers committed suicide. They had nothing, and they were trying to secure a city for days. 
   Well, it is hard to look at this, but we have to look at it. We have to do it with an independent commission. We have to make sure people who are counting on us get their lives back. And we can do it. This is America. But we need to hold people accountable. We need to be credible with our response. The job is a tough one, but we need to do it, and we need to do it soon. We  owe nothing less to the people we represent. 
   Madam President, thank you.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there has been so much misinformation on the filibuster I want to make sure I put my thoughts into the record. We hear Republican Senators actually get up and say they never filibustered any judges. I was stunned, so we went back into history and we have a chart for that. 
   The first filibuster in modern times was started by the Republicans in 1968 against Abe Fortas for the Supreme Court. We know there have been 11 in recent times, 11 filibusters. Here is one in 1971, probably started by the Democrats, William Rehnquist to be a Supreme Court justice. Here is one in 1980, probably started by the Republicans, Stephen Breyer, to be a judge on the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Then in 1984 Harvie Wilkinson, Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1986, Sydney Fitzwater, to be a judge for the Northern District of Texas. 1992, Edward Earle Carnes to be judge on the Eleventh Circuit. 1994, Lee Sarokin to be a judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1999, Brian Theodore Stewart, to be a judge for the District  of Utah. In the year 2000--and this is my State--there was a major filibuster; we fought hard and we beat the filibuster. We got the votes needed, Richard Paez to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and Marsha Berzon to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit. 
   When we hear Republicans say they never launched a filibuster, you can ask, what? Here is Bob Smith who led the filibuster, Republican, from New Hampshire. Here is what he said:  
   ..... It is no secret that I have been the person who has filibustered these two nominations, Judge Berzon and Judge Paez.  
   Here he is again:  
   So don't tell me we haven't filibustered judges and that we don't have the right to filibuster judges on the floor of the Senate. Of course we do. That is our constitutional role.  
   Here is a Republican Senator who started a filibuster against two judge nominees for the Ninth Circuit. He called this a ``constitutional role.'' Now we have other Republicans saying the constitutional option is no filibuster. Wrong. You are contradicting your own people here. 
   Now, ORRIN HATCH himself admitted there were filibusters on the floor:  
   Indeed, I must confess to being somewhat baffled that, after a filibuster is cut off by cloture, the Senate could still delay a final vote on nomination.  
   That is ORRIN HATCH. This is the major point I want to make, Who is the real leader out there pushing to end the filibuster on judges? Pushing, pushing, pushing? 
   And, by the way, it is unbelievable we have confirmed 205 of George W. Bush's nominees to the courts. We have stopped 10. Let me say it again: 205 have gotten through and we have stopped 10. 
   Now, do the math, and I will say to you: In your life, if you get 95 percent of what you want, wouldn't you go around with a smile on your face? I would. If I got 95 percent of what I wanted from the Senate, I would be so happy. If I got 95 percent of what I wanted from my family--if they sought my way 95 percent of the time--I would be happy; especially when they were teenagers, I would be really happy. 
   But do you know what. If I were arrogant, and I wanted everything, and I thought I knew best all the time, and I wanted to grab all the power, I would be sunk. So these folks over here, who got 95 percent of what they wanted--205 judges, and then 10 whom we thought were out of the mainstream--and, by the way, wow, are they out of the mainstream--they are unhappy. And now they are going to change the rules in the middle of the game. 
   For 200 years of our Constitution we have been able to speak and express ourselves. I have to tell you, this is dangerous to our democracy. When one party wants its all, when one party wants to stop minority rights, that is dangerous. And that is where we are. 
   But here is the best of all--and I hope people will know this--when we had this filibuster on Marsha Berzon, and when we had this filibuster of Richard Paez, guess who voted to keep the filibuster going on Richard Paez. I will give you a clue. He appeared on a big screen over the weekend. I will give you another clue. He was elected by the Republicans to be the majority leader of the Senate, BILL FRIST. He says filibusters are terrible, filibusters are wrong. Yet he voted to continue the filibuster on Richard Paez.

   Mrs. BOXER. So let's hold people accountable for what they do and say. I admit I was foolish on the filibuster when I was a freshman and I came in here. I also wanted everything to go my way. I was wrong. And it is hard for a Senator to say they are wrong. We do not like to admit it. But I was wrong. But how can BILL FRIST lead the charge, say that filibusters are wrong, it is terrible, it is awful, it is against the Constitution, and everything else he says--which I do not agree with any of what he said--and then not address the fact that he voted to sustain a filibuster. It does not make sense. 
   We have soldiers dying in Iraq, in Afghanistan. Lord knows where they are going to go in this very dangerous world. And the mission: to make sure democracy thrives. Do you know that when I was in Iraq, we were told one of the reasons the minority groups there, the Kurds, felt comfortable was they knew they were going to copy the model of this democracy, including the filibuster? 
   They said: Oh, we know we are going to have our rights heard because we are going to have the right to filibuster. They even told that to a Republican Senator who went over there. 
   By the way, when I was in the Palestinian territories--this is another interesting part of my trip--the first thing the Palestinians said they want to do is make sure their people get a monthly social security benefit that is guaranteed. I truly wanted to ask the Minister there--I think he was the Minister of the Interior--to please contact President Bush and tell him that a guaranteed social security benefit was their first priority, as the President tries to undo the guaranteed benefit for Social Security. That trip I went on was fascinating in so many different ways. But mostly, what I realized was, we need to be the model of freedom and democracy. If we start taking away minority rights, if we start saying we cannot stand to hear each other--by the way, I understand it. I know it is painful to hear me speak for some of my colleagues who do not agree with me. They say: Oh, I can't listen to one more word. And I feel the same way when they start talking about things with which I fundamentally disagree. 
   But that is what it is about here because all of America has to be represented here, from the most liberal, to the most conservative, to everything in between. All of us have to feel represented. But if we stop the ability of the other to debate and discuss, especially on judges, where it is a lifetime appointment, at a very high salary--they never have to face the electorate. This is the only moment. 
   So what if we say they have to meet a higher bar? That is a good thing on behalf of the people. Because--guess what--do you know what they rule on? They rule on everything to do with your life. They rule on whether there should be child labor. They rule on whether you should be harassed and exploited in the workplace. They rule on whether you have the right to clean air and safe drinking water. They rule on everybody's rights: voting rights, civil rights, human rights. They rule on whether your child can get a good education. They rule on whether corporate America must provide a safe workplace for you. They rule on whether the Federal Government can say that people who pollute have to clean up that pollution. 
   Why do you think there are so many people who want to get every single judge? Because they want judges of a certain philosophy. That is wrong. We should work for mainstream, fair judges--that is what we need on the bench--who can see all sides. But when one side wants everything, when 95 percent is not enough, when 205 to 10 is not good enough, beware of what is coming down. Do not change the rules  in the middle of the game. That is not fair. That is not right. It is throwing a fit over something, when you have gotten 95 percent of what you want. 
   You do not change the rules in the middle of the game, like they did in the House on the Ethics 
   Committee. Do not do that. That is not right, it is not fair, and it is wrong. It is wrong for the American people. 
   Everyone in the world looks to America--everyone in the world. When we start weakening our rules around here, and weakening the rights of the people to exercise the rights they have been given as Senators, we are in a lot of trouble. 
   So, Mr. President, I have gone through a number of issues, starting off with the most solemn, which was reading the names of those in the military who have died, who were either from California or were based in California. I promised my constituents I would always come to the floor periodically to remember them. The saddest thing: 26 percent of the dead soldiers happened to be either from California or based in California. That is a huge number. So it is with a very heavy heart that I did that. 
   But we have a lot to do, a lot on our agenda. I hope we will stay focused on the things that matter to the people--on the things that matter to the people. Let's not spend time changing the rules of the Senate that we have had for so many years. Let's not do that. Let's do the work. Let's get a success strategy for Iraq. Let's get health care for our people. Let's get education for our children. Let's make sure the air is clean and the water is safe, that we protect our beautiful places. Let's make sure we attack this issue of gas prices, which in my State we are seeing $3 a gallon. I wrote to the FTC, and I said: Please investigate what is going on with the refiners. Please look at these mergers that are coming at us now that will make it even worse. 
   We have work to do. But, no, we have to have our leader go on a Sunday, or whatever, and--big publicity--address a group about changing the rules of the filibuster. This does not meet the test, it seems to me, of doing the job. 
   We know there will be fallout. That is the nuclear option, and nuclear explosions have fallout. It doesn't mean shutting down the Senate, but I can assure you, it is going to mean working harder in the Senate, working really hard, working on some things that maybe we haven't worked on in a while, forcing that. But I have to tell you, 205 to 10, you should be smiling, not frowning, not addressing people and saying how terrible you are doing. You should be happy. It is a heck of a lot better than a lot of Democratic Presidents have done. You should be happy. 
   You should bring us judges that are mainstream, and there wouldn't be any filibusters. I have supported so many. You succeeded 205 times. You failed 10 times because you tried to put people on there who really were so far out of the mainstream it would be dangerous. 
   Can't we compromise this thing and come together? Let's get back to work.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have all watched in horror as the Gulf Coast has been struck by what could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, leaving unimaginable suffering in its wake. It is difficult to put into words how heartbroken we are for the Americans affected by Hurricane Katrina. 
   Brave souls everywhere are still searching for some family members, while trying to keep others alive and hopeful. We have seen the inspiring courage of the survivors and dedicated men and women working around the clock to help them. 
   Thousands of people have lost their lives. Far more have lost life as they know it--their families, their homes, their communities, and their jobs. 
   There has already been an increase in people filing for unemployment benefits due to Hurricane Katrina. And, the jobs that have been lost will be gone for a long time. 
   To help people who have lost their jobs because of this crisis, I am introducing the ``Hurricane Katrina Reconstruction and Displaced Worker Assistance Act of 2005.'' 
   This legislation would give priority in awarding Federal contracts for the rebuilding efforts to those companies where workers displaced by Hurricane Katrina comprise at least 25 percent of the workforce fulfilling the contract. This will help provide jobs to those who have been severely affected by the hurricane.  
   We must show those who have suffered so much that their government will help them rebuild their lives. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill to provide help to State and local first responders in purchasing interoperable communications systems--so that everyone can talk to one another during an emergency. 
   This need has been glaringly apparent for over a decade now, but especially since the 2001 terrorist attacks. It was all the more evident in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 
   The 9/11 Commission described the inability to communicate as ``a critical element'' at the World Trade Center and at the crash sites, where multiple agencies and multiple jurisdictions responded in September 2001. And yet four years after that attack, our first responders still cannot talk to each other. 
   Let me mention just one example from the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. 
   National Guard members have compared communications capabilities in New Orleans unfavorably with those in Iraq. Ground commanders for New Orleans have been functioning without the ability to track the location of some units reporting to them. This is unacceptable. 
   Almost every community I visit in California--from big to small--mentions the need for interoperable communications for first responders and the need for assistance from the federal government. California suffered from a lack of interoperable communications in the fall of 2003, when communities could not communicate with each other to convey what was happening with fires that were sweeping through the State, greatly complicating the response. 
   We need to provide funding so that State and local first responders can purchase the technology that makes interoperability possible. We need to do our job at the national level and provide our first responders with the resources to protect our communities in the case of a terrorist attack, natural disaster, or other emergency. 
   I have tried to get funds for interoperable communication systems as part of the Intelligence Bill, the Rail Security Bill, and the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill. The time to act is past. We need to get this done before the next disaster strikes, which is why I am reintroducing this bill. 
   My bill would authorize $300 million for each of the next 5 years to help State and local agencies improve existing communications systems or purchase new systems. This funding would help local agencies purchase equipment for real-time interoperable communication between first responders. 
   Guaranteeing that first responders will have the communications equipment necessary to respond to a future attack is exactly the kind of preemptive action we should have taken after 9/11 and should be taking now. 
   A report on the needs of first responders by Warren Rudman and Richard Clarke found that fixing this problem would cost $6.8 billion. My bill does not fund this all, but we need to do something. 
   This bill is an important step in fulfilling our federal responsibility to protect our citizens during emergencies. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor the Martinez-Nelson-Corzine-Boxer amendment to strike the OCS inventory language from the Energy bill. For millions of Americans living near our coasts, this amendment is arguably the most important we will debate on this bill. We know huge numbers of people live within 50 miles of America's coastlines. Few things are synonymous with California more than the beautiful beaches and the coasts. We have some pictures to show what this means to our children. 
   This is a scene I remember with my own children and now with my own grandson when he comes to visit California. This is what we think about. The natural beauty that is the California coast helps form our State's identity, as these pictures show. I will show you another one at this time as well. When I look at this, I just think: California. 
   The coast is a huge reason so many millions of Americans have chosen California as their home. Indeed, out of our 36 million Californians, 21 million Californians live in coastal counties. That is roughly 64 percent of the State's population. And there is a reason for it. This is God's gift to our State and to the people of this country and, frankly, to the people of the world who come to spend time on California's coastline and beaches. 
   The California coast is home to dozens of threatened and endangered species, including the short-tailed albatross, California Gnatcatcher, sea otters, chinook and coho salmon, steelhead trout, guadalupe fur seal, and several species of whales. Our coast is a true national treasure. 
   But Californians are not the only people who treasure our coastline. We know that tourists, millions of them, come to our State, generating $51 billion in annual revenues for our State. The protection of California's coasts, frankly, as much as all the other coasts we will protect, is not just an environmental necessity, it is an economic necessity. 
   The underlying bill could very well lead to more offshore oil drilling, could devastate my State and its way of life, and I trust that this bipartisan legislation being offered by Senators MARTINEZ and NELSON will be agreed to because the inventory that is agreed to in this bill could encourage further drilling in the not-so-distant future, putting all of our coasts at risk. 
   Make no mistake about it. This inventory is not a benign compiling of a grocery list of resources. The inventory proponents would have us believe that, but it is really not benign. The inventory will be conducted using seismic air guns which use explosive blasts to map rock formations beneath the sea. Sound from these blasts can be detected for thousands of miles, and hundreds of millions of blasts would be required to survey America's Outer Continental Shelf. These seismic blasts have been shown to have major consequences for marine life. So I do not see how it makes sense to say, on the one hand, we are protecting our beautiful coastline with moratoria and then allow the inventory to go forward in these areas. 
   Most fish use hearing to detect predators, find prey, communicate, and find mates. Loss of hearing can have profound, even fatal effects on our fish. 
   So why would we take God's precious gift and subject it to this kind of trauma? Frankly, it is wrong. To me, it is almost a moral issue, that we protect the beauty we have been given, this God-given beauty.

   Mrs. BOXER. Seismic air guns have been shown to result in severely diminished fish catches by so severely startling the fish, they quickly leave the area or descend to the sea floor, seeking shelter from the noise. One study showed that when seismic blasts had been conducted in 1996, catch rates of cod and haddock declined between 45 percent and 70 percent over a 1,400-square-mile area, and 5 days later the catch rate had still not recovered. 
   I ask for an additional minute on top of my minute to finish. 
   The fact is, with so many fishery stocks already depleted, should we really do anything else to harm them, and can our fishermen afford the risk? 
   Marine mammals such as whales also use sound to locate food, avoid predators, care for young, and navigate the oceans. Seismic blasts can interfere with all of these critical activities. Air gun blasts have been observed to affect the feeding behavior of sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico, migrating bowhead whales in the Beaufort Sea off the Alaskan coast, and harbor porpoises, which appear to be dodging and evading the sounds dozens of miles away from the blasts. Indeed, last year, the International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee concluded that the increased sound from seismic surveys was cause for serious concern. 
   Mr. President, I see the Senator from New Jersey is here. We are running out of time, so I am going to wrap this up and cede the rest of the time to the Senator from New Jersey. I hope everyone supports this bipartisan amendment before us.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the Boxer-Smith-Durbin STOP-TB Now Act of 2006. This bill would authorize additional resources to fight tuberculosis, a deadly infectious disease that knows no borders. 
   In January, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a long-term strategy was developed to cut in half the number of TB cases and deaths. This Global Plan to Stop TB estimates that the 10-year cost to control tuberculosis is $56 billion, including $47 billion to detect and treat TB and $9 billion for additional research and development. If this plan is implemented over the next 10 years, it is estimated that it will save the lives of 14 million people throughout the world. 
   Tuberculosis is a deadly disease, especially in the developing world. Tuberculosis kills nearly 2 million people per year--one person every 15 seconds. One-third of the world is infected with the germ that causes TB and an estimated 8.8 million individuals will develop active TB each year. Tuberculosis is a leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and of people who are HIV-positive. 
   While developing nations are most heavily impacted by TB, there is also a concern here at home. It is estimated that 10-15 million people in the United States are infected with the germ that causes TB. And, California has more TB cases than any other State in the country. Ten of the top twenty U.S. metro areas for TB case rates are in California; San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, Fresno, Los Angeles, Stockton, Sacramento, Ventura, Vallejo, and Oakland. 
   This funding is a wise investment for our Nation. A recent article published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a $35 million investment in the health system of Mexico to fight TB would yield a savings to the U.S. taxpayer of $108 million in terms of reduced TB healthcare costs domestically. 
   I have been working with Senator Smith to fight the spread of international tuberculosis since 1999. I am proud that he has been such a strong partner on this issue. And, I am grateful for the support of Senator Durbin, a champion on the issue of global AIDS and other infectious diseases. 
   The Boxer-Smith-Durbin bill is consistent with the Global Plan to Stop TB, including the goal to reduce by half the international tuberculosis death and disease burden by 2015. It also sets a goal to detect at least 70 percent of cases of infection tuberculosis, and the cure of at least 85 percent of the cases detected. 
   The bill authorizes not less than $225 million for fiscal year 2007 and not less than $260 million for fiscal year 2008 for foreign assistance programs that combat international TB. It also creates a separate authorization of $30 million for the Centers for Disease Control to combat international TB. 
   This bill will not only save lives, it will help reverse a troubling trend--the emergence of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis caused by inconsistent and incomplete treatment. In the U.S., a standard case of TB takes 6 months to cure at the cost of $2,000 per patient. A case of multi drug-resistant TB can take up to 2 years to treat costing as much as $1 million per patient. 
   TB kills more people than any other curable disease in the world. I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important legislation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have asked for this time so I could talk about the issue that is really hanging over the head of the Senate, as Senator Baucus said when he gave his support to the highway and transit bill: What we can do when we work together. What we can do when we set aside the partisanship. What we can do when we work for our people, rather than make up a phony crisis about the courts and threaten to change more than 200 years of tradition and threaten a nuclear option--which was named by the Republicans, by the way, when they thought about it because it is so vicious, it hurts so hard, it has such fallout that it will change the very nature of the Senate. But more importantly, it will change the way we now can protect the people of the United States of America. 
   This is a very simple chart. It shows the numbers 208 to 10; 208 represents  the number of judges President Bush has been able to get voted into office as a result of actions of this Congress since he got into power. Two hundred eight of his judges have gone through. This Senate has stopped 10, 10 of his nominees. Actually, some of my colleagues remind me now it is really only five because some of them are no longer up for judgeships or we have relented on a couple of them, but I am going to be fair to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and paint the worst possible picture in terms of the number we have stopped--10. 
   This is a 95-percent success rate. I ask the people of this country to think about what it would mean in their lives if they got 95 percent of what they wanted. If their child came home on a regular basis with 95 percent from school? That is an A+. If their spouse said, ``Honey, I agree with you,'' 95 percent of the time and you got your way 95 percent of the time, you would be smiling. 
   When you went to work and you had a pretty tough boss, and your boss called you into the office and he said, ``You know, you are a fine worker, Barbara. You are a great worker. As a matter of fact, I have looked over your work, and I have agreed with you 95 percent of the time,'' I think that is the moment I would ask for a raise. 
   If you get what you want 95 percent of the time, you should have a broad smile on your face. You should feel good about yourself. You should feel great about yourself. 
   But you know what, if you wanted 100 percent all the time, if you never wanted to give 1 inch of space, if you demanded that your child get 100 percent every time, you would not be happy. I call it the arrogance of power. 
   What we are seeing in the United States of America is an arrogance of power. My colleagues--and particularly the White House--are not happy getting 208 of their judges but not getting 10 of their judges; they are not happy with 95 percent results. What do they do? They say: We want to change the rules of the Senate. All right, what are the rules of the Senate? The rules of the Senate say on a nomination as important as a judge, which is very key, following the Constitution, which says a President must take the advice and get the consent of the Senate, there can be extended debate on that judge. To stop that extended debate, it requires not 51 votes; it is 60 votes. That is how we have operated for a very long time. 
   By the way, it is important to note, it was even harder to get a nomination through. For a while, it was 67 votes. Before that, there was endless debate. You could never stop debate, ever. We have eased that rule. 
   We believe it is important for a lifetime appointment to the courts--and these are very important positions. They are paid a lot of money. They get a great retirement, not like United Airlines, they will get their retirement. We believe they ought to be terrific--mainstream, at least. And to stop extended debate, they have to pass a little bit of a higher threshold: 60 votes. Some of these nominees are so outside the mainstream they cannot get 60 votes. So the Republicans said: We will just change the rules. They looked in their little rule book, and they found it takes 67 votes to change the rules of the Senate, and they said: My goodness, we do not have that. Maybe we have 51 with the Vice President voting with us--he votes on a tie vote--but we do not have 67 votes. So let's go about it in a way that no one would ever expect. We will raise what we call a point of order, have a ruling of the Chair, and the Chair will rule--and it will be DICK CHENEY--that the Senate can no longer filibuster judges. Then we will have a little disagreement over that. They are getting 51 votes, they think. Maybe not. We do not know. 
   That is the nuclear option. A lot of my colleagues on the Republican side are nervous about it, and they will wind up, if they get 51 votes, changing the rules of the Senate without the 67 votes. 
   Imagine what would happen at a baseball game if in the middle of the game someone said there is no such thing as a home run, or it is an out if the ball bounces first and you throw the person out at first base. People would go nuts. You do not change the rules in the middle of the game. That is not the American way. And you do not do it in a backdoor effort. I have voted to change the rules, but I do not try a sneaky way. I said you have to get 67 votes to do it. If you do not get the 67 votes, the rules are the same. 
   I take my time on this because it is important the American people understand what the Republican leadership is trying to do. They tried to change the rules in the House because they did not want to investigate TOM DELAY, who is the leader over there. They changed the rules. It was so shocking, they backtracked after months of the American people saying: That is not the American way. The people of the United States of America are saying it today. They are saying it by 60 to 70 percent of the vote: Do not change the way the Senate has done its business. 
   Anyone who saw the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' knows that Jimmy Smith in that film was able to stand on his feet and be heard for a righteous and just cause. A little bit later, I will show an example of a judge we stopped and why it was important to stop her. 
   Let the American people and my colleagues understand. Here is what is important. This should not be about political parties, folks. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt was President--as we all know, a Democrat, considered one of the greatest Presidents ever--he made a huge mistake in his Presidency. He wanted to pack the Supreme Court. He did not like their decisions. 
   At the time, the Democrat party had 74 seats in the Senate. They could have done it in a heartbeat. All they needed was just a few to peel off, they had it. What did they do? Democrats in those days, colleagues, stood up to the most popular President in history. He had gotten more than 60 percent of the vote. They said: Mr. President, we think you are great, but we are not going to pack the courts just because you feel they are not upholding all of your New Deal. It is not fair. We need a check and balance. 
   I know young people watching or listening to this debate understand what we are talking about. The checks and balances built into our Constitution--the courts check the legislature and the courts check the executive branch. What my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, save a few, want to do is take away that check and balance, have one party rule. And, oh my goodness, they did not get enough of what they want--208 to 10--and they are throwing a fit and trying to change the rules of the Senate. That is wrong and doing it in a way that is absolutely contrary to what we say has to be done to change the rules, which is 67 votes. 
   Now, the next thing they will say is there have never been any judge filibusters until the Democrats. We have never done that, say the Republicans, we are so good we have never done it. 
   Let me tell the truth, the facts. Who started the filibuster in recent times? The Republicans. In 1968, Abe Fortas, to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court--Democrats' choice--he did not get the required two-thirds at that time. They need 67 votes of Members supporting Abe Fortas. Republicans started it. 
   Then we had a filibuster for a while against William Rehnquist, but it was dropped; Stephen Breyer to be judge on the First Circuit Court of Appeals in 1980; Harvie Wilkinson to be judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1984; in 1986, Sydney Fitzwater to be a judge; in 1992, Edward Earl Carnes; in 1994, Lee Sarokin; and in 1999, Brian Theodore Stewart. In 2000, two Californians were filibustered by my Republican friends: Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon. When we hear the Republicans say, we have not been, ever, for a filibuster, just say, you are making it up. They are making it up. Here they admit to a filibuster. Here is Bob Smith, Republican Senator, March 7, 2000:  
   ..... it is no secret that I have been the person who has filibustered these two nominations, Judge Berzon and Judge Paez.  
   So when the Republicans say there has never been a Republican filibuster, they are making it up. Of course there has been. 
   By the way, that was their right.

   Mrs. BOXER. Here is one. I want us all to remember the Enron case, a case where counties and cities and individuals were ripped off and went into debt--in our State, billions of dollars--by Enron, Enron who said they would deliver electricity and then made believe there was a shortage and jacked up the price billions of dollars. People went bankrupt and counties went bankrupt and the State went in the hole $9 billion. She was the only member of the court to find that a county could not sue a utility company for illegal price fixing that had substantially increased the county's costs for natural gas. 
   So here she is again hurting consumers, hurting local government, and standing alone in the process. 
   Here she is on a right to a fair trial. This is interesting. The courts have ruled over and over that when a criminal defendant comes into court before there is a verdict of guilt, you can't bring that criminal defendant in in shackles and in a prison uniform because you put in the jury's mind that the person is guilty. So you give the chance to the person to come in dressed as a civilian, then you find out the details and you find them guilty or innocent. 
   In this case, she was the only member of the court to find nothing improper about requiring a criminal defendant to wear a 50,000-volt stun belt while testifying, the only member of the court. That is how outside the mainstream she is. 
   If we could put back up the 208-to-10 number while I give the rest of my remarks, that would be fine. 
   What do we have here? We have a circumstance that 10 times out of 218, Democrats believed the President's choices were really harmful to the American people, would really be harmful to them, whether it is their minimum wage, whether it is their 40-hour workweek, whether it is the ability of all of us to protect our kids from cigarettes, whether it is to protect victims of violence, it goes on and on. You have seen just a handful of the cases. 
   So when somebody says to you: Well, those Democrats, they are blocking everybody--and if you listen to my Republican colleagues, that is what you would think--no, we have blocked 10. We have approved 208. In reality, now the number is 5, but circumstances have changed. I will lean over backwards to be fair and say it is 10. That is 95 percent. In each case of these 10 you will find out why we have done it. It is because these nominees are so outside the mainstream that they will hurt the people we represent. 
   Why is it important to say that a judge needs to have a 60-vote threshold to end extended debate? It is because it is a lifetime appointment. The President is supposed to work with the Senate before choosing a nominee, which he has not done, not on our side of the aisle. I tried hard with Mr. Gonzales when he was White House counsel. I met with him on numerous occasions, and he said: Senator Boxer, give me some names of Republicans. I gave him so many names of good Republicans for the Ninth Circuit. 
   I said: Look, these people are mainstream Republicans. They will fly right through here. 
   No, they couldn't be bothered with that. I know Senator Feinstein has done the same, given them the names of people who would be quite acceptable. Who do they send us? People such as Janice Rogers Brown, 
   people who are so outside the mainstream that we don't deserve to be here if we don't raise the arguments. 
   Now, what you are also going to hear is the Republicans have called this the nuclear option. They have renamed it the constitutional option. That is humorous--if you want to find humor in any of this. That is like saying that clock over there is a table. I suppose if I told you that often enough, maybe you would believe me that once upon a time that clock was a table. But the clock is a clock and the nuclear option is the nuclear option. It was named by the Republicans. But it is not popular out there because of the connotation, so they are trying to change it. 
   The ``constitutional option'' is the reverse of the truth. In the Constitution, it says nothing about guaranteeing a vote. It says the Senate shall write its own rules. Well, the Senate wrote its own rules and the Senate said it takes 67 votes to change our rules. Our colleagues don't have 67 votes to change the rules, so they are trying to do this sneaky parliamentary move to change the rules. What a way to govern because you didn't get 100 percent of what you want; you got 95 percent. I don't feel sorry for any President who gets 95 percent of what he wants. 
   I am telling you, Democratic or Republican Presidents have to work with the Senate and the House and they have to compromise. So it is very important to note that when you hear the Republicans saying all we want is the constitutional option, you say, where in the Constitution does it give you this right? Nowhere.  
   Then they will say this: Everybody deserves an up-or-down vote. Everybody. I don't know how many times we have given Janice Rogers Brown a vote. We gave Janice Rogers Brown a vote here once, and Priscilla Owen got a vote four times. Yes, the vote required 60 as the threshold to end extended debate, but they got their vote. Now, when you go back to Bill Clinton, 61 times his nominees got stuck in committee; 61 of Bill Clinton's nominees never got to have a cloture vote. They never got a vote. They were pocket-filibustered in committee. We have never done that. Every single Bush nominee who has come to the floor has had their vote. I know of none who have not had a vote. They just didn't meet the 60-vote threshold. 
   That is the second thing you are going to hear: All we are asking for is an up-or-down vote. They had that, but they had to meet the 60-vote threshold to end extended debate. Why? Because they are lifetime appointments, we are checking and balancing the power of the executive by saying don't send us people such as Janice Rogers Brown, who is so out of the mainstream. She sees a military uniform on every senior citizen and says senior citizens want to cannibalize their grandchildren. Excuse me? She says there is no private property left in this country. That is outside the mainstream to the extreme. 
   If we Democrats have the courage of our convictions to say no 10 times, give us a little respect; don't try to change the rules in the middle of the night. Do what the Democrats did in the 1930s. Think how good you would feel if you stood up to the President of your own party and said: Mr. President, we will follow you anywhere; we think you are terrific, and we support you in Iraq and on privatizing Social Security, and we support you in your huge deficits; we support you in these trade agreements, we support you this way and that way; but we don't think packing the courts is a good idea. Therefore, we are going to join with the Democrats and say no to this plan. It is very dangerous. 
   I want people to understand. The point of my discussion here today is to put a human face on these judges. This isn't about just numbers, although the numbers tell a heck of a story. The Republicans get 208 and not 10 and they are crying and doing this in a sneaky way, without getting 67 votes to do it. That alone is wrong. It is not playing fair, it is not the American way, it is not playing by the rules. The American people want to know it. If you want to fight with us, we will have a debate, but stick with the rules. Get your 67 votes so you can have the arrogance of power. Get your 67 votes so you can tread all over us. But don't do it in this sneak attack, challenging the Parliamentarian, and then having the Senator in the chair say, you know what, it is over; no more filibusters on judges. 
   If you do that, you are hurting the American people. Some people say it is about the traditions of our country, the right to unlimited faith, freedom of speech, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' I will stand on my feet, that is my God-given right for my State to do that, and that is all true. But for me personally, as a Senator from the largest State in the Union, with 36 million people, I want to protect them. I want to protect the 17-year-old who got raped and not have her come before Janice Rogers Brown and have her stand alone and rule against her. I want to protect the worker who wrote a little e-mail to another worker and said I don't think the boss is being so fair, what do you think? They said we had 2 weeks vacation and now they are counting that day off as one of those days and it is not right, and have to be before Janice Rogers Brown who says the corporation can write anything they want, but you are too lowly. I don't want to have the American people subjected to a judge such as Janice Rogers Brown, who said any city that helps a disabled elderly person get housing is wrong and is destroying private property. I don't want to have my kids in a circumstance where they have to see their grandmother called a ``cannibal.'' I don't want to have a judge who overturns Social Security, who overturns the minimum wage, who overturns the 40-hour workweek. 
   The point is, I want to protect the people I 
   represent. So if I don't stand up strongly against a judge such as her, I don't deserve to be here. The people of my State would be upset with me. 
   The right I have in this magnificent Senate today is the right of the minority. We have 45 Democrats here and 55 Republicans. I am counting JIM JEFFORDS as a Democrat for the purpose of discussion because he votes with us. So it is 55-45. JIM JEFFORDS is an Independent, but he votes with us. By the way, in the recent polls, the Independent voters are for the filibuster; 54 percent are for the filibuster. I want to protect the people I represent, because Janice Rogers Brown has been nominated for the DC Circuit Court, meaning one step below the U.S. Supreme Court. So she is going from the California Supreme Court, where she has dissented in a third of the cases, in a court that has--and you may be interested in this--six Republicans and one Democrat. Janice Rogers Brown has dissented 31 times. This is how out of the mainstream she is. I think it is important to note. 
   In the DC Circuit, there is a whole other area of the law that was protested--your right to breathe clean air, your right to drink clean water. This is important for us because environmental laws protect our health, and if we have someone in the court there who doesn't think Government has any right--and she obviously doesn't--to do anything because--what is it she said about Government? If you could put that chart up again. Whenever Government gets involved, this is what she predicts happens. We will show you the quote. Obviously, she doesn't think there is anyplace for Government because she says: ``Where government moves in''--I would say in a circumstance such as the Clean Air Act, where we tell folks you have to make sure the air is kept clean--``community retreats, civil society disintegrates, and our ability to control our own destiny atrophies ..... families are under siege.'' 
   I don't know what country she is living in. She says: `` ..... unapologetic expropriation of property; the precipitous decline of the rule of law; the rapid rise of corruption, the loss of civility and the triumph of deceit.'' 
   What an optimist. Why are we promoting someone who has this negative view of America? Doesn't she know this is a government of, by, and for the people? That is what we are about. Do we make mistakes sometimes? Yes. Do we have to make sure we fix our laws so they work better? Yes. But to say whenever Government moves in, community retreats, I wonder what she thought of the highway bill we just passed. She probably thinks it is awful because we take the gas taxes and we build highways, and we build transit systems because we think it is important for economic growth. But she says when Government moves in, community retreats, civil society disintegrates, and the result is families are under siege and there is war in the streets. 
   So, yes, I am here to say I did stand up against Janice Rogers Brown, and whether she has to meet a 60-vote threshold, which she has been unable to get, or a 51-vote threshold, I will be fighting against this nominee because she is way out of the mainstream. She walked away from judges in her own political party and stood alone 31 times. That is why we have said to the President: Why don't you talk to us about these nominees? We could have told you this one would have trouble. We would have given you the names of some fine conservative Republicans. But not someone who has this wonderful life story, but has a view of America that is amazing. 
   Here is what she once said in a speech:  
   Most of us no longer find slavery abhorrent. We embrace it. We demand more. Big Government is not just the opiate of the masses; it is the opiate.  
   Her point is we are slaves to our Government. Well, again, I don't know what country she is living in. We are not slaves to our Government. We run the Government. We get to vote the people we want in and we get to vote them out. If we don't like what they do, we will let them know. She is out of step, calling senior citizens militant, saying they are taking all of the goodies and free stuff. She doesn't like the minimum wage, doesn't like the 40-hour workweek, doesn't like senior citizens. She never protected women. She doesn't protect our children. She doesn't protect our consumers. She  doesn't protect our workers. Why do we want someone such as that to get a promotion? 
   Therefore, the Democrats have said to the President, through our voice in the Senate: Send us someone else and we will be delighted to work with you. We have worked with you 208 times, Mr. President, and 10 times we said no. 
   We said you are out of the mainstream, and the response of a 95-percent success record by the Republicans--and a few are not going along with it, and bless them for that--is: We will take away your right, Democrats, to stand up for the things you think are important. We will take away your rights by changing the rules in the middle of the game, by skirting a 67-vote requirement for changing the rules. We will do it. 
   There is politics being played. The majority leader talked about this in a speech in a political way, which was wrong. He has not agreed to a compromise. Senator Reid has offered several. The fact is, people have to know what is at stake. 
   I hope everyone within the sound of my voice will know the reason why Democrats have stood so firmly against the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown. It is because we care about the people we represent, and we care about mainstream judges, and we do not want to see such a radical individual get this position and begin to whittle away at the rights our people have won, at the fairness our people have won. 
   This is very important. This vote is going to change the Senate forever. But more than that, it will impact the lives of the people. Changing the Senate, changing tradition, changing the role of the minority to make a difference, to be heard, freedom of speech--these are all important. But at the end of the day, it is about our kids, our grandkids, our seniors, our families, our workers, the air we breathe and the water we drink, and this is all connected to the judges. This is not disconnected. This is the brilliance of our Founders who said the judicial branch, the judges, shall make sure that everything we do in the legislative branch and in the executive branch is constitutional, is right, is reasoned. 
   If we have people on the bench who believe that anything we do disintegrates our family; that anything we do, such as the highway bill, for example, turns into an expropriation of property and the rapid rise of corruption and the loss of civility and the triumph of deceit--this belongs somewhere else, not in the courts. 
   Mr. President, I thank you for your patience. I thank my staff who has done an extraordinary job for me in analyzing these decisions. This is not easy to do because you have to go line by line. I know the Presiding Officer knows these cases can be very long and confusing. My staff are attorneys. They are also very smart attorneys, and they were able to get to the point of these cases and bring home this message to people that when we fight against 10 judges out of 218, it is for a reason. It is not because we want to be difficult. It is because we believe when the Constitution says the Senate has the right to advise and consent on judges, it does not mean when the President feels like it. It does not mean between the hours of 11 and 1 on Wednesday. It means every time he sends a nomination to us, he should have, in fact, sought the advice and consent of the Senate. 
   We have a big debate coming up tomorrow. I just wanted to give a little reality check so people understand for what we have been fighting. 
   I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support the Boxer-Snowe amendment. It is very important to make sure women around the world are given the health care they deserve. Since 1973, the Helms amendment has been in place. That means no American funds can ever be used for anything to do with abortion. But the global gag rule which we are trying to overturn goes much further. It says nonprofit organizations overseas cannot use their own money to help a  woman by giving her options, by giving her a referral. It even says a nongovernmental organization would lose all their USAID funding if they advocated to change a very restrictive law in their own country. This is clearly unconstitutional if it were applied here in America. 
   With our men and women dying around the world for freedom, I do not think we should say there should be no freedom of speech in these countries. We overturned this law many times. I hope we will do it again. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment to overturn the so-called Mexico City policy which undermines some of our country's most important values and goals. The Mexico City policy is also known as the global gag rule, and I will explain what it does in a moment. 
   Most of my colleagues know the history of this policy. It was named the Mexico City policy because that is where it was announced in 1984. But it is also known, as I said, as the global gag rule because that is exactly what it does--it gags international organizations that receive USAID family planning funds. 
   What does that mean? It means, for example, that a family planning clinic in Nepal that receives USAID funding is prohibited from using its own funds--the clinic's own funds--to provide, advocate for, or even talk about abortion to the women they serve, even talk to a woman about her options. 
   Let's be clear what we are talking about one more time. We are not talking about spending one slim dime or one penny of U.S. money to pay for abortions abroad because that has been illegal under the Helms Act since 1973. So since 1973, U.S. funds abroad cannot be used in any way to advocate for abortion, to allow women to have an abortion, or to refer her for an abortion. U.S. funds since 1973 can never be used for any of those purposes. 
   We can debate that, but I am not going to debate that. What I am going to debate is why the greatest, freest country in the world, the United States of America, would put a global gag rule, put a tape over the mouths of organizations that are trying to help the women in their country if they use their own funds--not U.S. funds but their own funds--for those purposes. 
   I cannot understand for the life of me how we can in good faith, as the leading democracy in the world, sending our troops abroad--and they are dying every day for freedom of speech and for the kind of constitution we hope others will have--how we could put a global gag rule on those organizations when in this country we could not even consider it for 2 seconds because it would be completely unconstitutional. 
   This is a free country. We are proud of the fact that it is free. We are proud of the fact that we do not tell our citizens what they can think, what they can say, if it is on their own dime. Yet abroad, in some of the poorest countries in the world, we are saying if they  want to get a penny of Federal funds, USAID or the like, they cannot use their own funds in any way they would like. We are telling family planning clinics that are in the toughest of circumstances, treating women in the direst poverty, that they are gagged if they want to receive any U.S. funds. 
   Again, these restrictions we are placing on these nonprofit agencies would be unconstitutional and unacceptable in the United States of America. 
   Ironically, what is very interesting is the global gag rule is even stricter than the requirements put on by the Helms amendment. So this is an unbelievable move by this administration, after these restrictions were removed in 1993, to place these restrictions back. 
   It is true that the White House, depending on who is in the White House, has shifted back and forth on the advisability of the global gag rule, but the Senate has always said it has no place as part of American law. The Senate has stood proud, Democrats and enough Republicans, yes, to make sure that we do not have a double standard, that we do not say with the one hand to these countries we want democracy for them, we want freedom for them, we want freedom of speech for them, and then on the other hand say, but if they exercise it they are going to be punished. 
   Tell me how that makes sense for America. Tell me how that makes any sense for our credibility in the world. 
   The last time we debated this global gag rule and the Mexico City policy in this Chamber was about 2 years ago. I introduced this exact amendment, and it passed with bipartisan support. We hope we will achieve that same outcome today. It will be a close vote--we have had some changes in this body--but we still think and hope we have the votes. We will find that out. 
   What is at stake is do we want to have an America that lives what it says, that not only says to the world freedom is good and freedom of expression is good, and if groups work hard and raise their own funds, as long as they spend them consistent with their own laws in their own countries, we will say it is their right. But, oh, no, that is not what this administration has done. One of the first things the President did when he got elected the first time was to put back in place this global gag rule. 
   This global gag rule is not fair. We are a country that believes in fundamental fairness. Yet this global gag rule tells foreign nongovernmental organizations--these are people working in the toughest of circumstances--how they should spend their own money. 
   For example, it tells clinics they cannot use their own money to help a woman in deep despair who comes in with a serious problem, an unintended pregnancy that perhaps was even forced on her. It tells the NGOs, the nongovernmental organizations, they cannot use their own funds even to advocate for less restrictive laws. 
   For example, let's say there is a law on the books in one of these poor countries that says if a person is raped or a victim of incest they cannot have an abortion, and in this country we changed that. If one is a victim of rape or incest we say Federal funds can be used to help her. Let us say there is a country that has a total restriction, even if someone is raped or there is incest involved, and the nongovernmental entity is trying to change that law in their country. Under the global gag rule we say they will lose all of their Federal American dollars if they advocate to change what I would call ignorant laws. 
   This global gag rule tells clinics that they cannot use their own funds to even tell a woman who comes before them what her options could be. Even if the woman asks what she can do, they cannot tell her. In our country, that would be illegal, unconstitutional. 
   But, no, we put this on the poorest nations of the world. That is not Uncle Sam, that is Imperial Sam, and none of us wants to be imperial. At least that is my impression. We want to be democratic. But we are not acting in a democratic fashion when we have this double standard around the world. 
   We believe in freedom of speech and yet the global gag rule tells foreign nongovernmental organizations they cannot in any way express an opinion on this subject without losing their funds. We do not tell organizations of the United States of America what they can say and what they cannot say in this country, even if we find it offensive. There are a lot of organizations that I find we would be better off without. I do not think their advocacy is right, but I have no right as a Senator to tell any organization in America I am tired of hearing what they are saying, do not say it anymore, because if I tried to stop them I would be ruled out of order, unconstitutional, and that would be the right thing. 
   Yet we do it to foreign nongovernmental organizations. 
   Some Senators just came back from Iraq. I was one of those people. We saw the unimaginable challenges facing our soldiers, government officials, and the Iraqis themselves as they struggle to deal with a very dangerous insurgency in that country. Our soldiers are putting their lives on the line so that the Iraqis have a chance to live in freedom. One of the foremost freedoms in our country that we wish for other people is freedom of speech. Government will not interfere with a person no matter what they say. As long as they are not hurting anybody or inciting anybody, they can hold an opinion. That is why our soldiers are over there fighting so that the Iraqi people can write a constitution that gives them the same freedoms we have. 
   We heard the Iraqis tell us, the up and coming leaders: We read your constitution, we read your history, we know about your filibuster, and how it protects minority rights. These are the Iraqis. We heard our soldiers say they are willing to risk their lives so the Iraqis can have freedom. Well, that includes freedom of speech. Yet we take away the freedom of nongovernmental organizations to tell the truth to the women who may come before them seeking help with their reproductive freedom. 
   Our policy should be a model for the world, but the gag rule instead sends a bad signal. It enforces a dangerous code of silence. It tells people if the government in power does not agree with them, then they should put a gag over their mouth and just suck it up and not tell the truth about how they feel and keep vital information from the women they are serving. Whether one is pro-choice or anti-choice, this has nothing to do with it. It is a question of freedom of speech. 
   I hope that regardless of how we come down on the issue of choice, we would agree that it is fair to debate it. I may not like to hear your opinion if I do not agree with you, it may be hard for me to handle, but that is part of this great country. We have to listen to each other. We have to debate and we have to respect each other's views. But I am not showing respect if I walk up to a Senator on the floor and say, you know what, I am tired of hearing your point of view and I am going to put a gag over your mouth. How ridiculous. If they did that to me? How ridiculous. It is freedom of speech we are talking about, and the global gag rule takes a hammer to our Constitution, to our credibility, and I think just knocks us down in the eyes of the world. And it makes hypocritical what we are asking our soldiers to do across this globe. 
   I want to give some examples. In Peru, for example, family planning NGOs funded by the U.S. were barred from advocating against a constitutional clause banning abortion. It was not the Peruvian Government gagging their own people, it was our Government. And it was not all Peruvian NGOs who were barred from participating in that debate, it was only those who opposed the abortion ban. The other people were free to talk about it. 
   What is that about? America comes in and says if you want our money you can only advocate for the position that the Government in power wants. You cannot have another opinion. I think that is beyond outrageous. 
   Just listen to what one nongovernmental organization leader in Peru said, and I am quoting this individual:  
   We used to hold debates, invite medical doctors, produce research publications. We cannot speak as freely now. No one knows at what point it becomes prohibited speech. USAID told us we couldn't lobby for abortion liberalization or decriminalization. If we attend a general conference and the issue of abortion comes up, we can speak. But we don't know how much we can talk about it before it crosses over to not being permitted anymore. We, for example, can do research on unsafe abortions, but if we draw any conclusions someone can say, ``that's lobbying,'' [and we will lose all of our money.]   
   This is a terrible thing, this global gag rule. I am so proud of the Senate. Every time we have brought it up we overturned it. I hope that will be the case today. 
   I want to tell you a story about a real case in Nepal. In 2001, this issue came to my attention. There was a nongovernmental organization that had to make a Hobson's choice: Do we take USAID money which we desperately need to help our people if it will force us to remain silent on the issue of reproductive freedom? What should we do? Should we give up the money and retain our freedom? 
   Let me tell you what this organization did. It gave back the USAID money, even though it put them in a very precarious financial position. They did it because of a 13-year-old girl named Min Min. I brought her picture with me to the Senate floor 2 years ago because I wanted my colleagues to see the face of what we are talking about here today. This is not just about freedom of speech. This is about real, live people and what happens to them if they cannot get reproductive health care. 
   Min Min was raped by a relative. She was raped by an uncle. She became pregnant, and it was a shame upon the family and the family said you must have an illegal abortion. As a result of that illegal abortion of a girl 13 years old who was raped by her uncle, someone was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Who was it? Was it the rapist? No. Was it the parents who said you have to end the pregnancy? No. It was this tiny girl, 13 years old, who was sent to jail for 20 years for the crime of being raped by a relative and being forced by her family to have an abortion. 
   The nongovernmental organization wanted to go to bat for this child, so they turned back American money. Can you believe it? We punished an organization that 
   wanted to go to bat for a 13-year-old rape victim--incest victim, really. We took the side of the rapist. That is what we did. We said to the NGO: If you want to help this child, give back the money because you cannot advocate for changing the law in your land. 
   So this clinic in Nepal turned back their money--our money--and fought for Min Min. She had her 14th birthday in prison. She had her 15th birthday in prison. But then, because they did not take American money and they were free to lobby in behalf of Min Min, they succeeded in changing the laws of Nepal, and they helped set that little girl free. 
   For their valor and their courage and their success in freeing a child from prison who was put there after she was raped by her uncle, this is what they had to do. They had to give up $100,000 in USAID funding, and they had to let 60 staff members go. They couldn't help more than 50,000 other people who desperately needed them. 
   These are the real stories behind this Presidential edict of the President, when he steps up to the plate and says I am putting in place a gag rule. 
   I am ashamed. I am ashamed that we were on the side of the rapist and against the side of a little girl who was a victim of incest. How can this Senate look at that story and say, yes, that's right, we want to be on the side of the rapist? Why should the rapist suffer? We don't want to change the laws in Nepal. To me, this example alone is enough reason to do away with this global gag rule. 
   Here is another point. We should always look at our policies and ask the question: Are our policies decreasing the number of abortions that take place worldwide because all of us want to decrease the number of abortions taking place worldwide. Frankly, the Mexico City global gag rule makes it far tougher to reduce the number of abortions. We support family planning counseling and care. We support family planning, I thought, because we want to prevent abortions. Between 1988 and 2001, modern contraceptive use in Russia increased by 74 percent, and the abortion rate went down 60 percent. So there is a direct correlation between contraception and education on how to use contraception and the abortion rate. I say this, even though I believe this should be a known fact, but sometimes we seem to forget it. So what happens when we punish a nongovernmental organization that is involved with family planning, such as that clinic in Nepal I talked to you about, that had to give back $100,000 and lay off 60 people? They could no longer serve the women who so desperately needed their help. 
   Is this President saying he wants to keep contraception away from women who are asking for it? Because if that is what he wants to do, this global gag rule is doing just that. This is a radical thing we are dealing with because when you tell agencies they have to make a deal with the devil, take money and then be gagged, many of them will say: I don't want your money. I would rather be able to advocate. 
   And if they do not take the money, then they are in a terrible circumstance because they have to lay off people who would otherwise go out and counsel young women about family planning. Then, when those young women, in the poorest of the poor nations, are desperate, unfortunately they may seek what we called here, when abortion was illegal, back-ally abortions--and women died. Many women have died, thousands every year across this globe, because of illegal, unsafe abortions. 
   I believe very much that family planning is the answer. It can bring us all together, whether we believe in a woman's right to chose or we believe the Government should be involved in it, 
   we should not tell a woman, tell a family how to live their lives regardless of what side you are on. My goodness. Family planning ought to bring us together. 
   For those of us who believe abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, the way to get to that place is to have adequate family planning. For those of us who believe the Government should prohibit the jailing of women and doctors who have or give abortions, they should want to have family planning services so we have fewer abortions. 
   Why don't we hold hands on this vote as we have in the past and walk down the aisle together across those divides and say family planning is the way to make abortion rare? That is the key. But the global gag rule has the opposite impact. The global gag rule is causing more abortions because the nongovernmental organizations will not take the funding, they won't be gagged, and they won't have the staff to go out and give those women the advice and the contraceptions that they are asking for. 
   There is another issue that comes into play here, and that is the issue of HIV/AIDS. Preventing AIDS is very important. The use of modern family planning methods will help us prevent AIDS. 
   This global gag rule is dangerous. It is dangerous directly, and it is dangerous indirectly. It goes against our Constitution and freedom of speech. If this President tried to put this kind of gag rule on in America, he would be laughed out of the courts. Of course, they do not do that because we have something called the Constitution and freedom of speech. We don't go around putting a gag on doctors who have their own practices. We let them do what they think is right--to do no harm and to help people. 
   I want to talk about a school in Uganda where three of its students died from unsafe abortions. The same man impregnated the three girls. It was a horrible tragedy. But the local clinic still didn't know what to do since it received USAID funding. They had a situation where three girls were impregnated by the same man, and they didn't want to give back the money they had gotten from the United States of America. This is what they said. 
   What should the school do? Refer the girls to the clinic? It is a very difficult situation for the nurses. What can they counsel about? It is a problem if the provider is a member of that community. A person cannot even speak as a community member or a parent. Because how can you differentiate between an individual and the fact that they are an employee of a nongovernmental organization? 
   The point here is that if someone in the clinic in the area where one man impregnated three girls in the school feels that he or she can't speak out in their capacity as an individual citizen because they work for a nongovernmental organization that could be forced to give up its funding--this is a very bad policy. We are saying to clinics throughout the world that are supposedly trying to help that you must choose between limiting your services  to a woman who comes to you in desperate need or shut down your doors because you have to give back the funding from the United States of America. It is really a stunning and unfair policy. 
   One of the Planned Parenthood chapters in my State is in Ethiopia right now. They are seeing firsthand the impact of the global gag rule on women's lives. Think about what it means to try to get health care in Ethiopia. If you are lucky, you might have only a 3-day or 4-day walk to a clinic--a 3-day or 4-day walk to a clinic in Ethiopia. 
   Less than 8 percent of the population has access to contraception. Only 20 percent get prenatal care. One in seven women die from pregnancies or unsafe abortions. In fact, backyard abortions are the second leading cause of death among women only, behind tuberculosis. 
   Because of the global gag rule that this administration has put in place, supplies to the largest planning provider in Ethiopia have been cut. They have been cut because they refuse to be gagged. 
   The people in Ethiopia are looking to America with our Constitution and our freedom and our freedom of speech, and they are saying: We are not going to allow the President of the United States of America and this Congress to gag us. We will have to give back the money. 
   That is the most counterproductive thing we can do. Why? Because they are running out of the contraceptives because they don't have the money. They are less able to serve rural areas, only 7 percent of which have access to basic sanitation. They are less able to curb the rising tide of HIV which is sweeping over the population, leaving shattered lives and families in its wake. 
   Why would we want to be responsible for that? We don't have to be today. We are going to have a chance to do what the Senate has done year after year after year. We have stood up for women's health. We have stood up for freedom of speech. We have stood up for the right of people--even the poorest of the poor--to get access to health care, to find out what their options are, to know what the possibilities are, to fight for changes in the law. 
   The Senate has stood on the right side of this issue--on the correct side of this issue--for years. I am so proud of the Senate. We did it with almost all Democrats and many Republicans standing with us. I hope that happens today. If it doesn't, a message will be sent throughout the world--yes, to our troops in Iraq who are fighting to bring freedom of speech around the world, that here in the U.S. Senate, we have just stood with a global gag rule. I hope that is not the message we send. 
   I don't want to see us continue this global gag rule. It is hurting the very people we say we care about--the poorest of the poor, the women, the girls, the victims of rape, the victims of incest. 
   The amendment I plan to offer and which we have actually set aside is identical to the one we passed 2 years ago. It is very simple. It simply says that nongovernmental organizations cannot be denied funding solely because the medical services they provide with their own funds include counsel and referrals. They cannot be denied funding solely because they use their own funds to advocate for new laws. That is all we say. 
   In this amendment we admit very straightforwardly that no NGO can violate its own country's law. If abortion is illegal and you cannot refer people in your country, if they say that is the law of the land, of course, we support people paying attention to the laws of their country. But we do not say, and we shouldn't say and we wouldn't say it here, that these NGOs shouldn't be able to lobby for new laws. This is very important. 
   In Nepal they sent a 13-year-old girl away for 20 years. She was a victim of an uncle's incest. They let the rapist go free and there were no penalties for the parents who forced her to have an abortion. That NGO, that clinic that turned back USAID funding, said we are not selling out our people. We are not selling out a child for some dollars. 
   I cannot believe the side that we were on. The global gag rule put us on the side of a rapist. That is what the global gag rule did. That is not a side anyone in this Chamber wants to be on. I hope everyone in this Chamber will vote to be on the side of the women who were the victims. They need us to be by their side. 
   Basically, what we are saying in our amendment is we believe in human rights. We believe in freedom of speech. We believe other countries should have the same freedoms we have in this country. And if we cannot gag people in this country, let's not do it abroad just because we can. Almost 60 years ago in the dark shadows of World War II, it was our country that championed the universal declaration of human rights, setting a standard for human rights all over the world. This is what that declaration said:  
   [T]he advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people.  
   That is America after World War II. Can someone explain to me how America feels it is on the side of the good when we will punish a nongovernmental organization that goes to bat for a rape victim who is 13 years old? We are not on the side of human rights. We are on the side of people who are doing evil. That is wrong. That is not what our Government ought to be doing. 
   The aspirations of our country and of our people should be reflected in our policies. That is why I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do what they have done over and over again: Stand up and be counted on the side of freedom and justice and the American way. It is the American way to foster freedom and justice, to allow people, even when we do not agree with them, to take their complaints and their points of view to their governments. That is what our soldiers are fighting for and dying for in Iraq, yet with this policy we stand on the side of tyranny. 
   I urge my colleagues to stand with us again. This is a bipartisan Boxer-Snowe amendment. I urge Members when the time comes--and I hope the chairman will let us know at what point we will be voting--I urge Members to stand with Senators BOXER and SNOWE in this bipartisan amendment to end the global gag rule. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I so appreciate my colleague coming to the floor and taking time to express his views, but I think it is very important to straighten out the record. 
   What my colleague is talking about is putting strings on U.S. taxpayer funds. That is the Helms amendment, and that has been the law since 1973. What the global gag rule does is different. It tells nongovernmental organizations abroad that they will lose U.S. funding if they use their own funds not ours, but theirs--to lobby to change egregious laws in their country. 
   In order for a nongovernmental organization to fight to change an egregious law, like the one that used to exist in Napal--which I know my friend would not agree with--that nongovernmental organization, I tell my friend, had to give back their USAID money because they were using their own funds to change the laws of Nepal. So we gagged this nongovernmental organization from helping a child who was raped. The rapist did not go to prison. The rapist--the uncle--was free. The parents did not go to prison even though they forced her to have an illegal abortion. The child went to prison. 
   The only way the nongovernmental organization was able to work to change the law in that country, which punished a child who was a victim of incest, was to give back the USAID money. Otherwise, they could not lobby for law changes in their own country. 
   Now, I use that example because it shows why this law is so egregious. And again, to make the point to my friend, the Helms amendment, which has been in place since 1973, already precludes U.S. Federal funds from being used by nongovernmental organizations in any aspect having to do with abortion. They already cannot use our funds to perform abortion. They already cannot use our funds to refer. 
   They already can't use funds to advocate. That is taken care of. The global gag rule is different from that. It is putting a gag around the very people who are trying to help prevent pregnancies, who are trying to help girls such as Min Min in Nepal who was the victim of incest. That is plain wrong. I don't mind my friend disagreeing with me. And we do agree on many issues and have worked together and will continue to. But I would hope we would not confuse the Helms amendment, which has been in place since 1973 and does not allow a penny of taxpayer funds to go in any way to the provision of abortion services. Don't confuse that with the gag rule, which keeps nongovernmental organizations from being able to use their own funds as they see fit to help women and girls in tragic circumstances such as the one I described by changing the repressive laws in some of their countries. 
   I urge my friend to please be clear that these are different issues. We already deny the use of Federal funds for anything having to do with overseas abortion or its lobbying. But the gag rule takes it a step further and says these organizations that work so hard in the toughest environments cannot use their own funds in the way they see fit to advocate for changes in the law, to help women understand what their options are. And it is antithetical to the United States of America, to freedom of speech. My friend knows we couldn't do that here. We couldn't tell people here that they can't talk to their patients. That would be unconstitutional. 
   I urge my colleagues to please vote on what this issue is, not on what this issue is not. We live with the Helms rule. We are not changing that. We simply want to get rid of this global gag rule today. I hope Members will vote aye on the Boxer-Snowe amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my colleague misses the entire point. The reason this child was sent to prison in Nepal after incest by an uncle and being forced by her parents to have an abortion is because of the former law in Nepal. And the policy my friend is supporting, the global gag rule he extolls, prohibited that clinic from going to bat for this child and using its own funds to change the laws. To do that, they had to turn back their U.S. funding. Are you proud of that? They decided, this nongovernmental organization, to give back the money because they felt it was that important to fight for that child who was the victim of incest and get that law changed. 
   It took them several years. That child had a 14th birthday in prison, and  she had a 15th birthday in prison. But they succeeded. One would think we would be on their side. One would think the United States of America would be on the side of a child who was raped and against a man who performed that act. One would think that is the side we would be on, the side of this child. But, oh, no, the global gag rule told that clinic: You cannot change the law because if you do that, you are violating the global gag rule. 
   That is the point. It is true there is an exception for rape and incest in the rule, but it does not apply if the country does not make an exception for rape and incest. So what we should say in those cases--at least work with me on this--is allow them to keep their money if they are working to change the law on rape and incest in their country. But my friend is not doing that. He wants the status quo. 
   Then we have the case in Uganda where three underage girls died from botched abortions. The same man impregnated them, and the clinic was afraid to help because they could lose all their American money. The girls died. 
   Is that what we are celebrating today, a policy that allows a child to rot in prison if she is raped, a policy that allows a rapist to be free, a policy that says three girls impregnated by the same man should die in a back alley? I hope not. This is very serious. This is not only about words. This is not a debate about when life begins. We can have that debate any day of the week. 
   I will tell my friend right now, I would die for his right to believe what he believes on that issue, and I hope he would die for my right to believe what I believe on that issue because that is a question between us and our God. That is not on the table today. 
   What is on the table is a real-life question: With whom do we stand? I hope when we come to this vote, which we are going to have shortly today, we are going to stand with the women and girls of the world who need our protection, not our vengeance, who need to know we are not going to gag the people who are there to help them, but, in fact, allow the people who are there to help them, to use their own funds to tell the truth about their life and their options and their health. This is a very serious matter. 
   Mr. President, if the other side will yield back its time, I will be glad to yield back mine; otherwise, I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to respond. 
   Again, my colleague has made my point. He read into the RECORD exactly what I said. Under the gag rule, you cannot perform abortions except for rape, incest, or life of the mother. That is right. But here is the second point: You cannot attempt to alter the laws, and that is the exact reason I cited for why the nongovernmental organization that is prohibited from altering the laws of their country had to give back their funding. That is exactly the point. 
   My friend made my argument for me by reading what I have been saying. This nongovernmental organization wanted to change the laws in Nepal so that a child who was raped or a victim of incest would not rot in prison. They were precluded from using their own money to alter the laws of their country. My friend read it right into the RECORD, and I thank him for that. He made my point. 
   So, yes, at the end of the day, we stand with the rapist in this case against the child, and that is wrong, and that is the reason I hope my colleagues will join with me. 
   I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is as if we are talking past each other. My friend made the case for me. He read the restriction which is that no organization can attempt to alter the laws of their country. And so we are standing against people having their rights at self-determination. Can you imagine if we sent out a notice to our people, let's say on both sides of the gun debate, and said to both sides: You cannot discuss this matter with your representatives. We could not do that for 3 seconds. First, we would be run out of office on a rail. But we are willing to be an imperial power and tell others in other countries they cannot advocate on behalf of the people of their country. 
   The last point I will make is my friend keeps repeating the phrase ``U.S. taxpayer funds.'' He is confusing the debate. There was an outright ban written in 1973 by Jesse Helms which has been upheld in the Congress ever since that not a dime of U.S. taxpayer money could be used in any way, shape, or form to provide abortion. And there is another law that says you cannot use U.S. taxpayer funds to lobby. So those things are already set. 
   What we are talking about is an additional law put into place by the Bush administration after it was off the books for 8 years which says forget about U.S. taxpayer money, we are telling nongovernmental organizations that to get that money, they cannot use their own funds in any way to provide abortion, to counsel women, to tell women their options, or--and this is the case in point--even to lobby their legislature to change laws, such as the one that put this child in prison who is the victim of incest. I do not understand how we can stand on that side of this issue. 
   I can give you 100 examples. I do not want to take the Senate's time to do that. The other case was in Uganda where the clinic was gagged and could not tell these girls where they could go to get a safe abortion to end a pregnancy forced on them by a gentleman--I should not call him a gentleman--a man who impregnated three of his students, and the clinic was scared to say anything, and these girls got illegal, what they call backyard abortions in that country and died. 
   Now, why do we want to stand on the side of the law that is resulting in girls going to jail when they are raped by a  relative and girls dying from botched abortions because we put a gag on the clinic? I hope this Senate will pass the Boxer-Snowe bipartisan amendment that will send a signal to the world that we believe very strongly in their rights to aggressively approach their government and talk about laws that may need changing, their rights to look a woman or a girl in the eye and say, look, regardless of what your religion is or what your feeling is, these are the options you have. 
   I do not think keeping women ignorant is a very liked policy, and anyone who votes for this global gag rule votes to keep the women of the world ignorant. I hope my colleagues will vote for the Boxer-Snowe amendment. I look forward to a successful vote. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to the chorus of praise for an extraordinary member of this institution--my dear friend from West Virginia, Senator Robert Byrd. 
   What a pleasure it has been to serve with Senator Byrd. 
   I am constantly inspired by his grace--his brilliance--and his unmatched work ethic. 
   Today we honor Senator Byrd for reaching the milestone of longest-serving Senator in history--8 terms--48 years--and 17,666 votes. 
   These are stunning numbers, but this legend is much more than the Cal Ripken, Jr., of the Senate. 
   Longevity is only part of the story. We know him best for his intellect, his devotion to the people of West Virginia, and his reverence for the institution of the Senate; for keeping a copy of the Constitution in his breast pocket--next to his heart--at all times, not for symbolism but for constant counsel, for having served beside 11 Presidents--both Democrat and Republican; for standing with them when their cause is just--yet never backing down from a fight with any President when he believes important principles are at stake, particularly when our role as a coequal branch of government is threatened. 
   And that is what I admire most about Senator Byrd: He always stands on principle and fights for what he believes, no matter what the odds. 
   What an inspiration this has been to me and to so many of us. 
   What an inspiration--his love of this country, his integrity, his absolute dedication to honest and principled government. 
   And what an inspiration--his 68-year partnership with his wife Erma--whom I know he misses dearly--and whom I know is looking down on him today with tremendous pride and love. 
   And it is for these reasons--far more than for his longevity--that we honor him today. 
   But anyone who knows Senator Byrd realizes that these words of praise are not sought because, despite his well-earned title of Senate Historian--Senator Byrd is not one to dwell on the past. He is a forward thinker. 
   For him, this special day is really just another day at the office. 
   Because as Robert Byrd knows best of all--there are crucial issues to debate. Problems to solve. And many more votes to be cast.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think we need to take a deep breath and a reality check. All this talk from Senator Allen about how obstructionist the Democrats are being--now, here is the truth: The Republicans run the Foreign Relations Committee. They did not even have the votes to vote John Bolton out of that committee and bring it to the floor with a positive recommendation. 
   This is a very divisive and controversial nomination. Since 1945, the Senate has confirmed 24 men and women to serve as U.N. ambassador. Never before has any President of either party made such a divisive and controversial nomination. In 60 years, only two nominees have had a single Senator cast a ``no'' vote against them. Andrew Young was one. He was confirmed 89 to 3 in 1977, and Richard Holbrooke was confirmed 81 to 16 in 1999. Every other time the nominee has been approved unanimously. I long for those days. 
   This is a President who said he wanted to be a uniter, not a divider. Yet in light of all the controversy, he sticks with this nominee. The fact is, 102 former diplomats, both Republican and Democrat, signed a letter opposing John Bolton. They wrote that his past activities and statements indicate conclusively that he is the wrong man for this position at a time when the U.N. is entering a critically important phase of democratic reforms. 
   Senator Voinovich said it well, and he is a Republican. He is a member of the committee. He said: Frankly, I am concerned that Mr. Bolton would make it more difficult for us to achieve the badly needed reforms we need. 
   John Bolton has said that there is no United Nations. He has said if the U.N. Secretariat Building in New York lost 10 floors, it would not make a bit of difference. How does someone with that attitude get the respect required to bring the reforms? 
   As we know, today is not about whether Senators should vote for or against John Bolton. Today is a different vote. It is a vote as to whether the Senate deserves, on behalf of the American people, to get the information that Senators BIDEN and DODD have taken the lead in asking for. By the way, Senator Lugar, at one point in time, had signed some of those letters requesting the information. 
   Why is this important? It is important because every Senator is going to decide whether to vote up or down on Mr. Bolton. We need to know what this information will show. Yes, as Senator Biden has said, we get the information, we schedule a vote. But we will look at the information. What if the information shows that, in fact, John Bolton was trying to spy on other Americans with whom he had an ax to grind? What if the information shows that John Bolton did not tell the truth to the committee and that he had written a speech about Syria which was misleading and which could have, in many ways, made that drumbeat for war against Syria much louder than it was? 
   There is a third piece of information that Senators DODD and BIDEN did not think was that important, but I still think is important and we have asked for, which is the fact that Mr. Bolton has an assistant, someone he has hired, who has outside clients so that while he, Mr. Matthew Friedman, is getting paid with taxpayer dollars, he has outside clients. 
   Who are these outside clients? We cannot find out. We called Mr. Friedman's office. The secretary answered. This is a private office, his private business, and she said: Oh, yes, he is here. He will be right with you. 
   Then, upon finding out it was my office, suddenly Mr. Friedman was nowhere to be found and has not returned the call. 
   I represent the largest State in the Union. Believe me, it is a diverse State. We have conservatives and liberals and everything in between. We have every political party represented there, and many independent voters. But they all want me to be able to make an informed decision. This information is very important. Therefore, I think today's vote is crucial. 
   There is one more point I would like to make. 
   Mr. President, I ask how much time I have remaining?

   Mrs. BOXER. This is the point. When we had the whole debate over a judge a long time ago, a judge named Richard Paez, at that time Dr. FRIST, Senator Frist supported the filibuster against Judge Paez. What he said in explaining his vote was it is totally appropriate to have a cloture vote--as we are going to do today--when you are seeking information. That is totally appropriate. 
   I have the exact quote here, and I would like to read it. He said:  
   Cloture, to get more information, is legitimate.  
   I agree with Senator Frist. It is legitimate to hold out on an up-or-down vote, to stand up for the rights of the American people and the information they deserve to have through us. 
   I thank Senator Dodd and Senator Biden for their leadership, and I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think we are about to have a very important debate about a very moral subject which deals with intentional dosing of human beings, including children, with dangerous pesticides. I say this is a moral issue. As a matter of fact, I believe I can call my amendment a faith-based amendment because every major religious organization in this country supports my amendment. 
   My amendment passed the House without a single dissenting vote. It was by unanimous consent. I am shocked and stunned that we even have opposition to this very simple amendment. 
   The amendment that was offered by my good friend, the Senator from Montana, in my opinion and in the opinion of people who know about ethics and science and pesticide testing, it is actually a very dangerous amendment. It is offered as, I call it a CY amendment, cover yourself amendment. You can vote for his amendment and then against mine. If you look at his amendment, it is a step back to what is happening currently. It is a dangerous amendment because we will push through a new regulation that already has been condemned by, as I say, every major religious organization in this country. 
   We will debate this for the next couple of hours, but I wanted to make a statement in reaction to the President's speech last night.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Florida. He is a protector of children, families, and the vulnerable of his State. His help on that CHEERS program and getting that stopped was an enormous contribution. Many times we do big things around here that deal with huge issues and we do not know the impact of our work for a long time. When one works for clean air, clean water, it takes a while. 
   I say to my friend from Florida, this is something he can be proud of because we together, as a team, with the help of some of our colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, were able to use the leverage each Senator has to force a cancellation of a program that was intentionally dosing little children with pesticides, paying off their parents who tended to be poor, giving the parents a video camera, and subjecting these children to dangerous chemicals. So I think we have to be proud that we saved some kids from this. 
   I want to say why my amendment is so crucial and why the Burns amendment is so bad if one cares about protecting children and families. The amendment I have offered with my colleague from Florida--and, by the way, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be added as cosponsors to this amendment: Senators SNOWE, COLLINS, NELSON of Florida, CLINTON, SCHUMER, OBAMA, JEFFORDS, KERRY, LAUTENBERG, REID, and LEVIN.

   Mrs. BOXER. I think my colleagues can see this is a bipartisan amendment. We want to protect our children. This has nothing to do with politics. We want to protect our families. 
   Here is what is happening. The Burns substitute, which he is going to try to tell everyone is better than the moratorium, essentially encourages the EPA to continue with their rulemaking. It says, go on, hurry, finish it up, and it does nothing to stop any of the testing that is going on right now. So it is a step back. It is a dangerous step back. 
   Now, why do I say that? I will tell my colleagues about the EPA rule that is coming at us if we do not stop this. This is straight from the EPA. We are fortunate enough to have this information today.  
   The Agency has decided not to include any proposed requirements relating to a Human Studies Review Board as suggested in the National Academy of Sciences recommendation 6-2.  
   The National Academy of Sciences--we looked for it so that we have ethical guidelines. The EPA has rejected the guidelines of the National Academy of Sciences and the Burns amendment says, oh, go right ahead, EPA, finish your regulations, and the Burns amendment makes no reference to the NAS. This is more from the EPA:  
   The promulgation of rules prescribing such details [establishment of the Human Studies Review Board] would unnecessarily confine EPA's discretion .....  
   So, in other words, they are admitting they are turning away the guidelines of the National Academy of Sciences because they do not want to be confined in doing what they do. 
   What do they want to do? When you find that out you will be rather shocked. Are you ready for this? I say to my friend from Montana, if this doesn't shake his confidence in his amendment, nothing will. This is a bombshell that I am about to tell you. 
   The EPA is considering continuing a limited number of scientific studies involving pregnant women--meaning they will be dosed with pesticides, fetuses--meaning fetuses will be dosed with pesticides, neonates of uncertain viability--and just for those of you who do not know, neonates are newborn babies--of uncertain viability--meaning they are ill; sick babies will be in these experiments, or nonviable neonates--meaning newborns who may not make it. They are going to dose them as well. 
   If we can't take a stand to protect the sickest of the newborn babies, then we don't deserve to be here. If we are going to stand with the pesticide companies against ill, very ill newborn babies, what are we doing here? We don't belong here. 
   Let's see what some of the religious groups are saying. For those people who want to have faith-based legislation, you are on the faith-based legislation when you support the Boxer-Snowe-Nelson-Clinton-Collins, et cetera amendment. This is the statement of the Leadership of Diverse Faith Groups on human testing. It is signed by the National Council of Churches and the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life.  
   Our faiths teach us to protect the vulnerable among us and to do so we need a moratorium on the use of human testing data in the registration of pesticides, not another study or report.  
   The Burns alternative is another study. But worse than that, the Burns amendment encourages and orders the EPA to get their regulations in place, regulations that, as I told you, allow testing on newborn babies and fetuses and pregnant women and desperately ill newborns. Why are we having a debate? Why aren't we all supporting a moratorium, a timeout, just as Christie Todd Whitman did, just as Carol Browner did? This is a bipartisan effort. 
   Unfortunately, we have to choose. Instead of walking down this aisle together and saying we will not allow testing on pregnant women--can you imagine testing pesticides on desperately ill newborn babies and testing  pesticides on fetuses? I just can't imagine that that is what we are going to do today by voting on the Burns amendment and telling EPA to hurry up with their regulations instead of taking a timeout. 
   Let's look at some of the churches that are involved in supporting the Boxer amendment. Let's take a look at the list of these churches and these religious organizations. I will just read some of them: The African Methodist Episcopal Church; the Alliance of Baptists; Archdiocese of America; the Diocese of the Armenian Church; Christian Church (Disciple of Christ); the Church of the Brethren; the Coptic Church; the Evangelical Lutheran Church; Friends United Meeting; Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America; International Council of Community Churches; Korean Presbyterian Church; Moravian Church in America, Northern Province and Southern Province; National Baptist Convention of America; National Baptist Convention, USA; Orthodox Church in America; Polish National Catholic Church of America; Progressive National Baptist Convention; Syrian Orthodox Church of Antioch; Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the United States of America; United Church of Christ; The United Methodist Church. 
   It goes on. 
   The reason I am reading this is this is very unusual to see a faith-based amendment that deals with morality, to have so many of our religious leaders supporting us and opposing the Burns amendment. Why do we even have a debate? Certain things are right and certain things are wrong. Yes, it is an issue of social justice. Who is going to step up to the plate and offer up their newborn baby? 
   Let's take a look at that again, the statement about testing on newborns. I think Senator Durbin is interested in this and said he wanted to ask a question about it. The fact is, all of the religious organizations have stepped up to the plate, in part, because of this. This is EPA's own words.  
   EPA thinks it likely that it will continue a limited number of scientific studies involving pregnant women, fetuses, neonates [meaning newborns] of uncertain viability, or non-viable neonates [in other words, desperately ill babies] in the future.  
   It is hard to imagine how anyone in the Senate could vote for an alternative which encourages the EPA to hurry up and produce their regulation, when we can all come together as everyone did in the House of Representatives and say: Time out, EPA. This is a moral issue.

   Mrs. BOXER. That is the essence. You can put lipstick on it but essentially the opposition is saying no to the Boxer amendment, and let's just tell the EPA to look at ethical guidelines and consider them and hurry up and issue a regulation. 
   Does it make any reference to the National Academy of Sciences, which has very strict regulations? It doesn't make any reference to any of the guidelines that are internationally recognized. So, in essence, the Burns amendment is the status quo with a kicker that we continue these studies and that, in essence, we say to the EPA: Hurry up with your regulation.

   Mrs. BOXER. This test is being paid for by the pesticide maker, who wants to say that they should be allowed to use more chloropicrin in their pesticide. They have paid the University of San Diego to do this. 
   The EPA accepted that study. In other words, they are saying fine, we are going to look at the results of that study. 
   It was Ronald Reagan who put a stop to looking at the tests that came out of World War II. Because after World War II, we saw what was going on with medical studies. Ronald Reagan was the one who said we are going to stop this. We are not going to even look at these studies because they are immoral. 
   What we are saying today is, it is immoral to take a young woman like this--and tell her, by the way, she is not going to be harmed--make her sign a waiver of liability so she cannot really recover if she is sick, pay her $15 an hour because she is a student and probably needs the money desperately, and not tell her what this other picture shows, the man in the mask, that she is breathing chloropicrin at a rate 12 times the rate that our Federal Government, our OSHA says is dangerous. 
   If you were to have a concentration of this chemical 12 times less than what these kids are getting into their nostrils, into their lungs, you need to wear this type of full-face plate respirator or powered air purifying respirator with organic cartridge to protect from the chemicals.

   Mrs. BOXER. That is the interesting question. Under Bill Clinton's administration, in the late 1990s, Carol Browner, the Administrator of EPA, stopped this kind of acceptance of these tests by the EPA. 
   Christie Todd Whitman agreed with her and stopped all of this and said EPA is not going to look at these. It is immoral. It is wrong. 
   It is only recently that this moratorium was allowed to lapse and the current Administrator--it is Leavitt, I think--started to accept these studies. So it is very recent. 
   Remember, we had two EPA Administrators who had said no to this. Now, suddenly we are back in the game of utilizing these studies and sending a signal out to the scientific world: Go ahead and do these dosing studies.

   Mrs. BOXER. Yes. Let me take back my time because the Senator from New York is on schedule. I want to make sure she has time to speak. But let me tell you this. The EPA's own words are that, in fact, they will consider testing on these neonates and the rest. 
   Yes. This is immoral. I would like to tell you, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, on their Web site, in 2005, say this:   
   We are very concerned about using humans for the direct testing of pesticides under any conditions, particularly when they will not receive any direct or immediate health benefit but in fact may be harmed.  
   So we are not here testing pharmaceutical products that may help a baby. We are here looking at harming a baby, harming a pregnant woman. 
   So the Boxer moratorium vote is very important. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, I thank the Senator from New York who has always been such a credible voice for our children and our families and for their health and well-being. 
   As she said, this should be what the younger generations calls a ``no brainer.'' We need a timeout. We do not need to have the Burns amendment passed, which will speed up the EPA regulation which allows the testing of pesticides on newborn babies who are ill. It specifically says ``ill newborn babies or near-death newborn babies.'' If we stand for something, we should stand with all the religious organizations in this country that support the Boxer amendment and oppose the Burns amendment. 
   I ask unanimous consent to be able to reserve the balance of my time until the conclusion of Senator Burns's remarks and that the quorum call not be counted against my side. 
   If I could explain to the Senator from Alaska, I only have about 5 minutes remaining, and I want to retain that time for when Senator Burns concludes. He knows this. I don't think he has a problem with it.

   Mrs. BOXER. The Senator from Montana has, as he usually does, made a very good presentation for his side. The only problem is he made a very bad presentation about the amendment I had written. In criticizing it, he is criticizing the Republican-run House of Representatives which passed this same amendment without dissent, including the one and only Congressman I know of who was an exterminator, Tom DeLay. So for all the eloquence about pesticides, the one person who was involved in the pesticide over there did not object. 
   And with all due respect to my colleague, I don't have to be lectured about agriculture. I have been elected three times from my State. Agriculture is an enormous source of pride to our State. I visited thousands of acres of farmland. I want the Senator from Montana to understand something about my State and my farmers. Not one of them called and said: Oh, Senator Boxer, we want to dose babies and infants and pregnant women and fetuses with pesticides. Not one. So let's set the record straight. Maybe he heard from some of his farmers. Not one called me. 
   Why? Because this is all scare tactics. They know we are testing pesticides on animals. They know we are using computer modeling. They know that research moves forward. I am one of the biggest proponents of developing new pesticides. 
   Then he uses the scare tactics. My God, if we have this moratorium--which, by the way, was put in place by Republican and Democratic administrations in the past--we won't be able to fight West Nile virus. Baloney. We are already using DEET. We know what to do. There are continuing studies and modeling going on. So let's get rid of the scare tactics. 
   I am offering a bipartisan amendment today that is the exact amendment that passed the House without a dissenting vote. The only people who don't like it are the pesticide makers. We have a chance to take a stand for the health of our kids or with the pesticide makers. That is just clear. We have a chance to take a stand with every major religious organization in this country. I have the list of those. The National Council of Churches, Jewish organizations, evangelical Lutherans, the Catholic bishops, all weighed in. My amendment is a faith-based amendment. 
   Then my colleague says: Let's not get emotional. Are we supposed to walk in here and lose all of our feelings? Are we not supposed to have emotion if we lose, for example, a constituent in the Iraqi war? If we visit Walter Reed Hospital, as many of us have done, are we supposed to check our emotions at the door when we are elected to the Senate? Let me tell you how I feel when I read about the kind of testing they are going to do which my colleague is endorsing with his amendment because he is saying the EPA should hurry up and bring out their regulation. By the way, he is wrong when he tells you it is a draft. It is a final draft, and we have the proof that this regulation was about to go for comment next week. So let's set the record straight. 
   Here is what my colleague supports. He supports an EPA regulation that says there will be a limited number of scientific studies involving pregnant women, fetuses, newborn babies of uncertain viability or nonviable newborns. Imagine, dosing a fetus with pesticides. Dosing a newborn baby. You want me to check my emotions at the door? Sorry. I will not be here and allow a rule to go into effect without doing everything in my power to stop it that is going to dose a dying newborn baby with pesticides because some poor mother is convinced to take $1,000 for it. This is just wrong. Why do you think we have all of these churches opposing the Burns amendment and supporting our amendment: We are appalled by the effort to go forward with yet another report--that is the Burns amendment--that does nothing to guarantee the well-being of the children and other vulnerable groups who are being subjected to pesticides by the chemical industry. We need a moratorium. 
   This moratorium was voted for without a dissenting vote in the House. Now my colleague calls for a thorough review based on the National Academy of Sciences standard. 
   There is not one mention of the National Academy of Sciences in his entire amendment. Not only is there not one mention there, there is not one mention of the Helsinki Accords. There is not one mention of any protocol that has ever been recognized nationally or internationally in his amendment. It is a general amendment. It is exactly what the EPA wants because they have told us, they don't want to be hemmed in. They don't want to have their options limited. They want to be able to dose or accept studies that dose people with chemicals whenever they want to and whoever these people are. 
   Here is what the EPA says they want: The promulgation of rules prescribing such details would unnecessarily confine EPA's discretion. Wonderful. My opponent is giving them that discretion by not referring to any acceptable scientific guidelines. 
   Then my opponent defends the CHEERS program. I have never heard anyone defend the CHEERS program. The CHEERS program was going to be done on these babies. Pay their parents in poor areas, give them a cam camera, tell them to continue dosing their homes with pesticides and study the reaction of the children, when we already know it is dangerous for kids to be exposed to pesticides. My esteemed friend--and he is my friend--actually gets up and defends this program which no one else in America has done. But it speaks to the purpose of his amendment which is to move forward with a rule that would allow all of this. 
   My opponent says I am stopping all testing. False. The testing will continue--animal testing, computer modeling. Do you know what Stephen Johnson of the EPA has said about human testing? I think it is important that Members know. He certainly doesn't agree with Senator Burns because this is his quote:  
   We believe that we have a more than sufficient database, through use of animal studies, to make licensing decisions that meet the standard--to protect the health of the public--without using human studies. 
   So my friend is contradicting Stephen Johnson, head of the EPA.

   Mrs. BOXER. The fact is the attack Senator Burns has made on my amendment is false in every way. It is the same amendment as his Republican friends supported over in the House without a dissenting voice. It is the same policy that was put in place by Republicans and Democrats. And then my friend says: Wouldn't it be a waste to throw away studies, even if they did intentionally dose human beings? Ronald Reagan was faced with that same  issue. His head of the EPA said there are certain times when you don't accept studies because there is moral right and there is moral wrong. That is why the Boxer amendment--supported by Senators SNOWE and COLLINS, Senators CLINTON and OBAMA and NELSON and others--is so important. 
   I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Corzine as a cosponsor of my amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this debate is a tough debate because when it comes to protecting the people of our country, there are going to be feelings on either side. This is what it is about. The quote of James Childress of the National Academy of Sciences, chairman of the panel, who said: A lot of us were troubled by the dosing studies. And personally my view is that the House amendment--that is what my amendment is--was within the range of ethically justifiable responses. 
   The fact is, there is no mention directly of the National Academy of Sciences in my colleague's amendment. My colleague's amendment is just a ``cover yourself'' amendment. I call it a ``CY'' amendment. 
   People can think they are doing something, but here is what I need to tell my colleagues: If they vote for the Burns amendment, they are taking us back. They are telling the EPA to hurry up with their regulations, regulations that we know will test pregnant women and babies. Every major religious organization views this as a faith-based debate, and the Boxer amendment is on the right side of that debate. I hope Members will vote for the Boxer amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I could have Members' attention just for one moment, I hope they will vote for this. The EPA is about to utilize studies that will actually intentionally dose babies with pesticides, pregnant women with pesticides, newborns with pesticides, newborns of uncertain viability, meaning they might die, nonviable newborns. We are talking about a policy that has won the condemnation of every religious organization in this country who backed the Boxer amendment. 
   The Boxer amendment passed without a single dissenting vote in the House. If Members voted for Burns they can vote for Boxer. All we are saying is we need a timeout to look at this immoral policy. That is why we have  the Catholic bishops telling us that the intentional dosing of kids is immoral and they are very concerned about it. That is why we have the support of the National Council of Churches. If my colleagues ever wanted to vote for a faith-based amendment, this is the amendment. Stand on the side of the innocent, vulnerable kids and vote for the Boxer amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Mikulski for taking the lead in organizing the Democratic women. We don't always agree on every issue, but here is one that has united us. I think what is interesting about the Democratic women is we are very different. We are very different ages. We range from the 40s to the 70s. We go from the west coast to the east coast, and places in between--the north and the south. When we can come together like this--knowing that some of us are progressive, some of us are more conservative--in a whole group and say we are going to protect Social Security, we hope it sends a very powerful message to the people of this country, particularly the women of this country and to their families, that we are going to be there for you. That is what this is all about. 
   Whose side are we on, anyway? I think in the battle over Social Security the sides are becoming very clear. You are either on the side of the families, of our people, young and older, or, frankly, if you follow money you are on the side of Wall Street because Wall Street is going to get billions of dollars if George Bush is successful, and it will come straight out of the pockets of working families. 
   I used to be a stockbroker so I have absolutely nothing against stockbrokers and I loved working on Wall Street. But I can tell you, and I am sure you know it is true, that markets go up and markets go down. I have seen elation and I have seen devastation. One thing I never saw was a sense of security that the stock market was going to be there necessarily when you need it to be there. 
   This year is Social Security's 70th birthday. It has been enormously successful. Before Social Security, over half of all seniors were poor. Today, 10 percent live in poverty. That is too much and we want to take care of that. What we do not want to do is go back to the days when 50 percent were living in poverty. So we, the Democratic women, are going to use every tool at our disposal to make sure the people of this country do not wind up in poverty. 
   Certainly we know Social Security needs adjustments, as your own family budget needs adjustments. We did a major adjustment in 1983. I was over in the House side. Senator Mikulski was over in the House side. With Ronald Reagan as President, we all got together, Democrats and Republicans alike, and we strengthened Social Security. Under Bill Clinton, we made some efforts to strengthen it again. The fact is, we have to strengthen Social Security, not destroy it. The fact is, Social Security is not a handout, it is a promise we make to working men and women in this country: You pay into the system, it is insurance, and it will be there for you in your retirement years. 
   Basically, when the folks on Social Security look at me and say, Will you fight for my Social Security? do you know what I tell them? You earned it, and of course I will make sure it is never taken away from you. 
   Unfortunately, President Bush's solution is to dismantle Social Security. He can call it anything he wants. He can say he is not going to change it for those already on it. But what about  those who are not already on it? Don't they have a right to have this insurance program, which has been there for so many years? 
   I will show you what the LA Times wrote. This is not a new issue for George W. Bush. He has been at it for a long time:  
   Even as a young man, Bush was sympathetic to revamping the program. When he ran for Congress in 1978 he argued that the program would go broke by 1988 if people were not given the ability to invest money themselves.  
   So here you have the candidate George Bush, way back in 1978, calling for privatizing Social Security. He said it would go broke in 1988. 
   That is what he said. He was wrong then and he is wrong now. We have to call it the way we see it. He underestimated the bipartisan will of Congress and President Reagan to keep Social Security for current and future generations. Instead of seeking to follow the path of Ronald Reagan, who was supposed to be one of his heroes, he is seeking a path that was plotted over 20 years ago to destroy Social Security. In the course of this debate--not today, at other times--I will share with my colleagues the roadmap that was laid down in the 1980s, a plan to destroy Social Security. George Bush was right there in 1978. 
   So he is misleading the American people by calling Social Security a crisis. According to the Social Security trustees, there is enough money to pay full benefits until 2042. According to the Congressional Budget Office, there is enough money to pay full benefits until 2052. So, yes, we need to make adjustments so we can keep this program secure, but we do not have to destroy it. 
   While President Bush is traveling around the country on Air Force One, telling people there is a crisis in Social Security--this is what is amazing--he is giving lip service to the real crises that are right here, right now, under his own nose and on his own watch. What about the crisis of the budget deficit? It is well over $400 billion, that deficit. You want to talk about bankrupt? In my family, if you are spending that much more than you are taking in, you are bankrupt. Let's call it what it is. 
   What about the crisis of the trade deficit, and the plummeting of the dollar? What about the crisis of the IOU that is given to our kids and grandchildren the day they are born? As Senator Reid has said, there is a birth tax on every child today--$36,000 worth of debt. We know the President is going to have to borrow trillions for his plan. 
   What about the crisis of 40 million Americans without health insurance? What about the crisis of millions of Americans, including 10 million children, who live within 5 miles of a toxic waste dump that is wreaking havoc on their health? What about the crisis of being unprepared for a domestic terrorist attack because we have not invested enough in rail security, port security, chemical plant security, aviation security, nuclear plant security? What about the crisis in afterschool programs, where hundreds of thousands of kids are left out because the President has frozen funding for 3 consecutive years? 
   I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute, if I might.

   Mrs. BOXER. The President's solution to Social Security is to borrow, borrow, borrow, throwing us deeper into debt. I will tell you, this is not going to happen under our watch. 
   I will show you one more chart very quickly. 
   The plan the President has talked about a lot results in benefit cuts of 45 percent. The average yearly payment for a widow would only be $5,700. Who can live on that? Certainly not those of us here or those in the White House. Widows would be 35-percent below the poverty line if the President's plan goes into effect. 
   We think Social Security Plus is a place we can start. Keep Social Security and strengthen it, as Ronald Reagan did. We can work together to do that for our young people. I think we can solve this problem and keep one of the greatest programs ever known in the history of our country. 
   I thank the Senator from Maryland.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill that we are considering has provisions to address this Nation's problems of grade crossings and the need for grade separations. 
   According to the Federal Railroad Administration, ``grade crossings are the site of the greatest number of collisions and injuries'' in the railroad industry. In 2000, there were 3,502 incidents at grade crossings. 
   This year in Glendale, CA, there was a tragic commuter train crash that resulted in 11 deaths and more than 200 injured. 
   In addition, the large volume of freight train traffic from California's ports to the rest of the Nation is a public safety hazard in many communities in California where traffic--including emergency vehicles--is severely delayed at these grade crossings. 
   In Riverside, CA, from January 2001 to January 2003, trains delayed ambulance and fire protection vehicles 88 times. This translates into more people possibly dying from health emergencies such as heart attacks, and larger and more deadly fires. If there is another terrorist attack, imagine what would happen if emergency first responders could not get across the tracks. 
   That is why I am pleased that this bill includes my language to require the Federal Railroad Administration to make recommendations to Congress on ways to fix this. 
   I am also pleased that this bill includes funding that States may use to separate railroad tracks and roads, and I am wondering whether the Senator from Missouri would enter into a colloquy on this matter.

   Mrs. BOXER. As I understand it, the Freight Transportation Gateways program has a provision--the ``Freight Intermodal Connections on the National Highway System''--that would allow States to use a portion of their highway funds to build bridges and tunnels for grade separations.

Does this include projects on grade separations?

   Mrs. BOXER. Finally, there is a third provision that authorizes grants for rail line relocation projects. This would create a grant program that would allow States to receive funding to improve rail lines that pass through a municipality. This includes projects on grade separation. As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I am  pleased that Chairman STEVENS and Ranking Member INOUYE included this provision. 
   These provisions are a good start. I hope to continue to work with my colleague to ensure that Federal funding is available to help States and localities undertake grade separation projects so we can improve safety and relieve congestion where railroads and highways meet.

   Mrs. BOXER. President, my amendment begins the process of putting all trucks operating in the United States, including those from Mexico, on an equal footing for emission standards with American trucks. Beginning in 2007, all trucks, including foreign trucks, operating in the U.S., will have to certify that they are meeting the performance emission standards of the Clean Air Act--the type of standards that American trucks have been required to meet for years. This provision will comply with our trade laws and help improve our air quality by assuring that foreign trucks are meeting our emissions protections. I thank the Senators from Mississippi and Hawaii for working with me on this amendment and for agreeing to accept it. 
   However, I believe it is only a start. I would have liked to include a provision requiring rebuilt engines to meet the standards in effect at the time the engines were manufactured. Such a provision would have covered more foreign trucks and ensured even cleaner air. 
   I understand the complications with including such a provision now, and I hope we can address this in Conference.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when a seat on the Supreme Court opened in July, I made a promise to the people of California. I promised I would only support a nominee I believed would protect their rights and freedoms. 
   After much thought, I have concluded that I cannot in good conscience give my constituents that assurance with the nominee we have before the Senate, Judge John Roberts. In fact, I am very worried that with Judge Roberts on the Supreme Court, the rights and freedoms that have made America a light to the rest of the world could be in serious jeopardy. 
   The question before the Senate is not whether Judge Roberts is a brilliant lawyer and not whether he is well qualified or well spoken or affable or unflappable. He is certainly all of those. But examining his credentials is where our analysis must begin, not end. The American people understand this. In poll after poll after poll, the American people say that before we vote, it is important to know where Judge Roberts stands on key issues that define us as Americans and what kind of country we will leave behind for our children. 
   The next Chief Justice will have the opportunity to steer a deeply divided Court and influence our lives and the lives of our families for generations. In recent years, the Court has issued 5-to-4 decisions to protect our air, to safeguard women's reproductive health and the rights of the disabled, to give HMO patients the right to a second opinion, to allow universities to use affirmative action, and to guarantee government neutrality toward religion. 
   With so many of our fundamental rights hanging in the balance, it is not good enough, in my view, to simply roll the dice, hoping a nominee will change his past views. It is not good enough to think this is the best we can expect from this President. I simply do not buy into that reasoning. And no, I don't buy into this reasoning either: Let's support this nominee because the next one might be worse. I will tell you why that rationale does not work for me and it will never work for me as long as the Constitution gives me and my colleagues in the Senate an equal role in this process. 
   It fails the bar that I set--the bar that says that I must be able to look into the eyes of my constituents and assure them that I feel confident in this choice. I said I could only vote for a nominee who would protect the rights and the freedoms of the people I represent. 
   I need to be able to look into the eyes of my constituents and to assure them I have made that judgment before I vote yes in their name. I can't do it here. We must demand far more in a nominee because the people we represent deserve no less. 
   I will vote no on this nomination because of what we know and what we do not know about Judge Roberts. 
   Long before President Bush made this nomination, we knew that his model judges were Justices Scalia and Thomas. 
   Now, President Bush isn't known for changing his mind, so that doesn't leave us in a good place if we're hoping for a moderate. Nor does a reading of Judge Robert's record while he served in the Reagan Administration 20 years ago. 
   In fact, some of Judge Roberts's writings raise serious concerns about whether he understands the ugly history of discrimination and injustice in our country, or the proper role of government in injustice and discrimination. 
   Of course, we were told over and over again by Judge Roberts and by this administration and some of his supporters: Do not pay attention to those memos; they were written long ago; he was just a young man; he was just a lowly staff attorney. Here is the point: Judge Roberts never backed away from those memos. When given the chance, he said over and over again they were written for someone else. Someone else is not up for the Supreme Court; Judge Roberts is up for the Supreme Court. So to simply say, Yes, I wrote that, but I wrote it for someone else, just does not pass the test. 
   Then we try to examine Judge Roberts' tenure years later as a top political appointee under the first President Bush. That is when he worked as Deputy Solicitor General for Ken Starr,  who was the Solicitor General. Again and again, Senator Leahy, Senator Kennedy, Senator Feinstein, all the Democrat Senators on the Judiciary Committee asked for documents relating to just 16 cases that would have shed some light on the way Judge Roberts approaches civil rights, reproductive health, the separation of church and state, environmental protection, and more. The Democratic women Senators asked too. But again and again, the administration refused to turn over the documents, and Judge Roberts refused to help us. 
   The President had access to that information when he nominated Judge Roberts. Why should this Senate a full partner in choosing the next Justice--have anything less? 
   This is not a small point of process. This goes to the heart and soul of what we are expected to do as Senators. We are supposed to be an equal partner in this process. We have the role of advice and consent to the President on judicial nominations. How can we do our job if the administration has access to information and yet we don't? I don't think it is fair. I don't think it is just.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for asking me this question. I could not agree more. The American people have told us through many polls that they want to have this information. They want to know. They believe it is more important and I believe the number was 77 percent said it was more important to know about where Judge Roberts stood than it was to know about his qualifications. Everyone agrees on his qualifications. The Senator is absolutely right. It is, to me, very disappointing that the judge himself refused to help us. 
   It is also my understanding--and Senator Kennedy, if I am wrong, I hope you will correct me--that when Judge Rehnquist was up for the Court, he also turned over documents from when he was a lawyer in government. So we had Judge Rehnquist, we had Robert Bork, and that was the right thing to do. 
   You have to ask the question, What are they hiding? The American people are very smart. They understand it. Why wouldn't one show the committee this information?

   Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator, I think what we have tried to do in this little exchange is make a point to the American people that information was denied to the Judiciary Committee, and that information was denied to the Senate. And, the only information we have is very slim. It is a 2-year stint on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   We have a lot of information from 20 years ago. So on the one hand, it is kind of a catch-22 circumstance here. When you go back 20 years ago, everybody says: Oh, that is old information. It does not reflect Judge Roberts. You ask Judge Roberts, he won't answer. He says he was writing for someone else. So we then need to look at the time in the 1990s when he worked in the Solicitor General's office. But, we cannot get that information. So we go around in a circle. 
   I have to say, if this debate were about a small matter, it would be one thing. But, we are talking about the future of this country. The importance of a position on the U.S. Supreme Court cannot be overstated.

   Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator, again you are making a very important point. The fact is, Senators on the Judiciary Committee--and I watched every minute of the hearings I could. I even watched the reruns of your hearings in the evening. You gave Judge Roberts ample opportunity in a very nice way to distance himself from his writings. He refused to do so. He simply said: I was doing this for my boss, and I was thinking like my boss. It is not good enough because he is the one who is up for Chief Justice. 
   I know Senator Bennett would like me to conclude, and I will do so. 
   In his reviewing his record, I also looked for some assurance in the decisions Judge Roberts wrote during his two years on the DC Circuit. But, again, nothing. In fact, some cases raised serious concerns about his commitment to protect the environment and his support of an all-powerful executive branch. 
   Judge Roberts had three days to tell the Senate and the American people what he really believes today. 
   He had the chance repeatedly to distance himself from the controversial positions he once advocated. He did not. 
   Let's face it: Judge Roberts was specific only when it mattered least and evasive when it mattered most. 
   Last year I ran for the Senate, and I ran a commercial that people said was very direct, but that is the kind of Senator I am. I said in my own words, right in that commercial, I would do everything in my power to ensure that we never go back to those dark days of back-alley abortions, when thousands of women died and many others were rendered infertile. 
   We know that Judge Roberts signed a brief calling for Roe to be overturned. It was one of those 16 
   cases the administration will not release. And it concerned one of the many important topics about which Judge Roberts refused to answer questions. 
   To simply say Roe is a precedent, which he said over and over again, is stating the obvious. Every case of the Supreme Court is a precedent. And to say you respect precedent, yes, every judge must respect precedent. But it does not give us an inkling into his views, and that is not good enough. 
   We deserved an answer to Senator Feinstein's questions about privacy: Does the right to privacy extend to the beginning of life and the end of life? We still don't know what Judge Roberts believes. 
   We deserved an answer to Senator Biden's question about gender discrimination. Does Judge Roberts stand by an interpretation of title IX that would have denied all remedies to a girl who was repeatedly sexually harassed by her teacher? We still do not know how Judge Roberts feels. 
   We deserved an answer to Senator Kennedy's probing questions about civil rights. Does Judge Roberts have any concerns about the constitutionality of landmark civil rights laws? We still do not know. 
   How could he be silent on those laws. They stand out in history as landmark moments that changed the course of human events in America forever, that finally spoke to all our citizens and told them they were equal, and the government would make sure they were protected and safe. 
   We deserved answers to Senator Leahy's questions about Congressional War Powers. We did not get them. 
   Now, Judge Roberts says as a Justice, he will ``just'' be an umpire calling balls and strikes. Of course, balls and strikes look a lot different depending on where the umpire is standing. And umpires have a lot of power to decide who wins and who loses. 
   So who will be the winners if we confirm Judge Roberts next week? Will it be the families of America? Will it be the children of America? Will it be the victims of violence? Will it be the poor and the powerless? Will it be the middle class? Will it be the environment? Will it be freedom? Will it be liberty? Will it be justice? Will it be our Constitution? Or will the winners be those who want to stop the national Government from acting to protect and defend our people and their rights and their freedoms? 
   I cannot tell my people that Judge Roberts will continue the steady march of progress that has defined our country's proud history. 
   So I will vote no. And because I believe the Senate deserves those 16 cases that Senator Kennedy talked about, and answers to our questions, I will vote no. 
   I hope and pray my doubts about Judge Roberts are misplaced and that he will join the moderate wing of the Court to protect the Constitution of this country that I love so much and the deserving people of my great State who will be counting on him to protect their rights and their freedoms. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. As you can tell from the clerk's reading, it is a very straightforward amendment. What I am offering in this amendment is to recommend to my colleagues we strike out the liability waiver granted to the makers of ethanol. 
   The purpose is stated very clearly in the beginning. It says: To ensure that ethanol is treated like all other motor vehicle fuels and that taxpayers and local governments do not have to pay for environmental damage caused by ethanol. 
   The amendment before the Senate, to which I have authored this second-degree amendment, brings, once again, to the Senate an ethanol mandate. Some think mandates of ethanol are a good idea. Others think it is a bad idea. I hope we all agree taxpayers and local communities should not have to pay to clean up any mess caused by ethanol. 
   The point of the bill is to force States--whether they want to or not, frankly--to utilize more and more ethanol, not as a crowning blow to the States that did not want to do this, by virtue of the fact there is a safe harbor for ethanol, meaning that no liability can be found for the makers of ethanol, but we are saying to cities, States, and communities, even if you do not want to use it, A, you are forced to use it; and, B, if there is a problem, we, the ethanol makers, will not be there to help you. It will fall to the local communities to pick up the tab. 
   A lot of people say ethanol is totally safe. I ask a commonsense question to the people of the United States of America who are going to have to make sure they are pumping their cars with ethanol in greater and greater proportion: If it is so safe, why are the companies seeking a liability exemption? 
   I have been around enough years to know if somebody says, Step right up, step right up, try this product; this product is completely safe; it can bring no harm to you; it is perfect, never a problem; but, by the way, before you ingest it or use it, sign a form that says you won't hold us responsible if you choke or you get cancer or you die. If somebody does that to you, I will say as the daughter of a lawyer, the wife of a lawyer, and the mom of a lawyer, do not sign away your rights. Do not sign away your rights. A light bulb should go on: What is wrong with this picture? If this product is so safe, why should I sign this liability waiver? 
   That is what is happening in this bill. We have had a vote on this before, and we have gotten anywhere from between 38 and 42 votes. It is important to go on the record again. 
   Why do I say that? We have had a terrible problem with MTBE where, thank goodness, there was no safe harbor. Communities such as Santa Monica and Lake Tahoe, communities in New Hampshire, and all across this country have been able to go back and hold the companies accountable for MTBE. The courts have said yes, communities, you have a right to hold these companies accountable for the damage done by MTBE. 
   Now we have a new mandate--ethanol. My colleagues who love ethanol, who want ethanol, who dream of ethanol morning, noon, and night--and this is not a partisan issue; it cuts across party lines--are giving the makers of ethanol a pass. This is a special interest loophole. 
   The exemption language starts off with this: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law''--and then they talk about the waiver. When you see that in the bill, put up your antenna. It raises red flags. You know then the public is losing rights. 
   ``Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law''--and then they do harm and put the waiver in there. It goes on to say that renewable fuels--that is ethanol--cannot be found to be defectively designed or manufactured. 
   This is the Senate of the United States of America. I did not know we were expert scientists and doctors who deal with environmental damage. We are saying renewable fuels--ethanol--cannot be found to be defectively designed or manufactured. Compliance with laws and regulations is not necessary to getting the liability waiver except for limited compliance requirements under the Clean Air Act. 
   My colleagues are going to say--I am sure the Senators from North Dakota, from Oklahoma--Senator Boxer is wrong. This is a narrow waiver. 
   Not true. The special interests and the people who represent ethanol will say the waiver is not really broad. It only protects these makers of ethanol from one type of lawsuit. 
   But let me state the type of lawsuit they are protected against. It is the only lawsuit that has standing in the courts of the United States of America. How do we know this? Look at MTBE. Lake Tahoe won their MTBE suit. Why? Because they were able to use the defective product liability claim. The judge, as a matter of fact, threw out the negligence claim, the nuisance claim. 
   So when my colleagues get up here and say, Senator Boxer is exaggerating, we are not throwing out the ability of people to sue--yes, we are because the only pathway for the public, for our cities, for our counties, for our States to hold people accountable for a defective product is the defective product cause of action. Losing that right to bring defective product liability lets the polluters off the hook entirely. 
   Again, I will talk about a San Francisco jury in a landmark case decided in April of 2002. The jury found that based on the theory that MTBE is a defective product, several major oil companies are legally responsible for the environmental harm to Lake Tahoe's groundwater. The jury also found many of these major oil companies acted with malice because they were aware of the dangers but withheld information. We did not have this safe harbor provision when MTBE was, essentially, mandated. Therefore, my communities in California and communities across the country are able to recover the damages. 
   Not so with ethanol. The makers of ethanol have made sure they are going to be covered and protected. It is an embarrassment we would do this. 
   This is the place we are supposed to protect the public interest. This is the place we are supposed to protect our people from defective products, not put in language that waives all the ability of people to sue on a defective product claim. 
   It is a scary thought if this were in place for MTBE--by the way, there is still a move to do that on MTBE, which is another issue for another day. It is a scary thought if we had done this for MTBE. My people in Lake Tahoe, the good people there, could be left holding the bag, and your towns and cities could be left holding the bag. If ethanol  harms public health or the environment, the loophole in the Energy bill risks leaving our communities with a mess. Polluters, not taxpayers or victims of pollution, should pay for harm to public health and the environment. 
   When gasoline leaks today, there is no loophole. The polluter pays. Why should the oil companies and the ethanol producers get off the hook if they cause harm? They should not. 
   So again, you are going to hear a lot of doubletalk when people stand up. They are going to first say ethanol is safe, there is no problem. And I say you say to them: If ethanol is so safe and you feel so comfortable with it, why do you need a liability waiver for the makers of ethanol? And then they are going to say: Oh, don't worry, we are only saying you can't sue because of a defective product. That is all. You can still sue for nuisance, negligence, all the other things, when, in fact, we know from legal history that the only claim that has standing here is a defective product lawsuit. 
   Now, to talk about ethanol's safety--Mr. President, I ask, how many minutes do I have of my 15, please?

   Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   According to EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in gasoline, which include ethanol and MTBE, ethanol is extremely soluble in water and should spread if leaked into the environment at the same rate as MTBE. It may spread plumes of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene because ethanol may inhibit the breakdown of these toxic materials. Although ethanol contributes some clean air benefits, it also increases the formation of nitrogen oxides, which lead to increases in smog. 
   So I think if you listen to the experts and you forget the special interests, you will support my amendment. We need to ask ourselves, are we in the business of letting people off the hook, people who have a responsibility for what they are putting into our gasoline, into our air, into the ground? 
   We mandated airbags, and we did not say to those manufacturers that they should not be liable. If there is a defective product problem with an airbag, people can hold the companies responsible if it does not work or it harms them. Why would we give a free pass to ethanol? There is only one answer: special interests, powerful, powerful special interests. There is no other answer that you can come up with. 
   If we do not learn from our mistakes, we are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. 
   My amendment will eliminate the special interest liability exemption for ethanol in this amendment. It means that ethanol will not be treated any better or any worse than other fuels. It will mean ethanol will be treated the same way as any other fuel. We should not shift the burden of cleaning up any problems caused by ethanol to our communities. The polluters should pay. The safe harbor liability exemption for ethanol should be taken out of this amendment. 
   I have to say to my friends, I know how anxious you are to have ethanol. I know it means a lot to the corn producers, and, frankly, it means a lot to my agricultural people. I have some good language in this bill dealing with ethanol made from other materials. But I still believe that my people who will produce this ethanol should not be left off the hook if there is a serious problem to the health of the people of the United States of America. 
   So the amendment is simple. I hope we can have a good vote, a solid vote on this amendment. 
   I yield the floor with the understanding that I will close the debate. Thank you very much, Mr. President.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am glad we are going to vote on my amendment. I understand that Senator Domenici will move to table. That is fine with me, as long as we have a vote. 
   Again, this is a very interesting issue in terms of what our responsibility is. As Members of the Senate, we have a responsibility to protect the health and safety of the people of our country. Why on Earth would we give a waiver of liability to the makers of ethanol when, in fact, we are not sure what is going to happen with heavy use of ethanol? We are not sure whether it is going to cause a problem for our people and who is going to have to pay to clean up the mess. 
   We know what happened with MTBE. We know it was in communities such as Lake Tahoe, Santa Monica, and communities in the Northeast and all across the country. I remember I had a map that showed where MTBE was a problem. It is practically in every State in the Union. The courts have made it clear that the people who made the MTBE have to come into these communities and clean it up. Now we are saying with ethanol, on the one hand, it is safe. Well, if it is so safe, why do we have to give it a special safe harbor and people give up their right to recover in their community in Tennessee or communities in California? 
   The fact is, they will say the waiver of liability is very narrow but, in fact, what they have waived is the only course of action a community can pursue. 
   Then you will hear: This is different because we are mandating ethanol. Therefore, we should protect the people who make it. We mandated airbags, and we didn't give a liability waiver to the people who make airbags. We mandate pollution control devices, but we don't give a liability waiver to the people who make it. So this is about the sheer power of special interests. 
   Let's not put our communities at risk. We could debate whether we ought to have this ethanol mandate. As we will see how it comes out, some people favor it, some don't. We should agree to protect our people. 
   I hope my colleagues will vote against the motion to table the Boxer amendment. I thank the Chair.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, had I been present to vote on the nomination of Gen. Michael Hayden to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, I would have cast a vote of ``no''. 
   I oppose General Hayden's nomination because of his role in the administration's program to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance on U.S. persons--a practice I believe is unlawful under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   During his nomination hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, General Hayden admitted to participating in the design of the electronic surveillance program during his tenure as director of the National Security Agency. And as the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, General Hayden became the chief advocate for the electronic surveillance program, even taking the unusual step of appearing before the National Press Club to defend the Administration's program. 
   We are all united in fighting terrorism, but we can do it in a legal and constitutional way that gets the bad guys and protects our values and freedoms. 
   While I oppose the nomination of General Hayden because of the controversy surrounding the electronic surveillance program, I wish him the very best and hope that he will turn out to be a strong and independent leader at the CIA. 
   But I also hope that the Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate will conduct careful and thorough oversight over General Hayden and the CIA to ensure that the civil liberties of U.S. citizens are protected.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today--as we celebrate international Women's Day--to strengthen and empower the women and girls of Afghanistan. 
   International Women's Day is an event celebrated world-wide to inspire women to achieve their full potential. But in so many places around the world, women continue to suffer from persecution and abuse, and many lack resources to become fully integrated  and equal members of society. Despite international intervention, Afghanistan is one such example. More than four years after the invasion of Afghanistan and the fall of the Taliban government, the women of Afghanistan still face significant hurdles as they seek to realize their full potential. 
   The maternal death rate for Afghan women remains tragically high--with an estimated 1,600 deaths for every 100,000 live births. The illiteracy rate for women continues to hover around 80 percent. 
   And perhaps most troubling, the security situation for women is getting worse--threatening to slow or even reverse the gains that Afghan women have made over the past four years. 
   Lieutenant General Michael D. Maples, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, recently testified that violence by the Taliban and other insurgents in Afghanistan in 2005 increased by 20 percent 2004 levels, specifically noting that the insurgency in Afghanistan ``appears emboldened.'' 
   Women and girls have felt the impact particularly hard. In recent months, attacks against schools in Afghanistan that educate girls have increased substantially. According to media reports, teachers and principals are being threatened and killed--the headmaster at a coed school was even beheaded in January--and eight schools have been burned in the Kandahar province during the current school year alone. 
   Just today, the President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai admitted that Afghan women and girls have much to overcome. ``We have achieved successes in various dimensions during the past four years,'' Karzai said. ``But this journey has not ended ..... women especially are being oppressed, there are still women and young girls who are being married to settle disputes in Afghanistan, young girls are married against their will.'' 
   The legislation I am introducing today, the Afghan Women Empowerment Act of 2006, will provide resources where they are needed most in Afghanistan--to Afghan women-led nongovernmental organizations, empowering those who will continue to provide for the needs of the Afghan people long after the international community has left. 
   The legislation will provide $30 million to these women-led NGOs to specifically focus on providing direct services to Afghan women such as adult literacy education, technical and vocational training, and health care services, including mental health treatment. It also provides assistance to especially vulnerable populations, including widows and orphans. 
   In addition, the Afghan Women Empowerment Act authorizes the President to appropriate $5 million to the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs and $10 million to the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission--two vitally important entities dedicated to advancing the cause of women and human rights within Afghanistan. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before we yield the 2 1/2 minutes, this issue of incest is extraordinary. The bill as written ``protects the predators on our children who have committed incest.'' All you have to do is read it. These parents, these fathers, retain their parental rights in the bill. And even under the Ensign amendment it says they cannot sue a friendly person for helping their daughter. The government under this bill can still go after a grandma, or a clergyman who says to a young child, Let me help you, your father raped you. Those vicious criminals retain all their rights. It is an absolute outrage. 
   The point is, why I am in favor of the Lautenberg amendment is the Lautenberg amendment says let us take a step back, let us prevent these pregnancies. And if people want to vote against teen pregnancy prevention, I guess they have a right to do that. How they would explain it is beyond me. We are talking 800,000 teenagers who get pregnant, and in about 18 percent it was not intended. 
   I thank Senator Lautenberg and yield to him the remaining time before the vote.

   Mrs. BOXER. I want to go back to the Lautenberg-Menendez amendment. It is extraordinary to me; when we try to talk about common ground on the issue of pregnancy prevention, doesn't my colleague believe one area we ought to all come together on, regardless of whether we call ourselves pro-choice or anti-choice, would be preventing pregnancies among teens?

   Mrs. BOXER. Here we had a chance to do something to prevent these unintended pregnancies. This bill focuses on a small number of cases. It seems to me by two votes we lost that vote. It is an issue, wouldn't my friend say?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have not yet had a chance to lay out my objections to this bill. I would like a chance to do that and, of course, those objections have just been elevated given the fact that by just two slim votes, we failed to adopt teen pregnancy prevention legislation, which is, of course, one of the most important issues we face in our society today. We have 800,000 young women whose pregnancies could have been prevented if they had such education. 
   Here we are dealing with a bill that seems to come back before the Senate every election for reasons that the other side can explain. Instead of tackling the issues of health care for our young people, insurance for our young people, pregnancy prevention for our young people, we are dealing with an issue that impacts just a few people. But so be it. 
   The good news is, we have had a debate on teen pregnancy prevention. The whole country got to see it, and they got to see where the votes lined up. It is pretty clear. 
   The other good news is that we had a debate on stem cell research, and we saw a very similar situation where we picked up a few votes on the other side but not enough votes. The President vetoed stem cell research. You want to talk about a health issue, you want to talk about helping the health of our young people who have juvenile diabetes or those who are paralyzed because of an accident; if you want to talk about helping people with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. But oh no, the President vetoed that. Another four or five votes in this Chamber could have made the difference between having stem cell research and not. But now we are not going to have it. 
   Frankly, in my State, we took matters into our own hands, and Republicans and Democrats together voted for stem cell research, and we have a $3 billion program. This isn't a partisan issue in my State. But oh boy, it is a partisan issue here. It just shows how far to the right we have come in the national debate. 
   So instead of doing something to improve a lot of our people, we are looking at this small issue. We are looking at a bill that, as it is now drafted, protects incest predators. We are working on that, hoping to come to some joint approach that can stop that problem, or part of it anyway. 
   As drafted, this bill throws grandmothers in jail and violates our Constitution. I would say this bill has a problem. 
   Again, we tried to make it better, but even our amendments did not go far enough. We did not have an exception for rape. If a young girl gets raped and she runs to the most trusted adult she knows, perhaps her grandma, and her grandma takes her into her loving arms because she is too scared to go to her parents for whatever reason. We have situations and I will share those with you where girls were so fearful, so frightened, and with good reason, that they couldn't go to their parents. So they go to a loving grandmother. And guess what? Under this bill, the parents can sue the grandmother. Unbelievable. That is Big Brother all right. Talk about family values interfering straight in. It is unbelievable. 
   We tried to fix the thrust of this bill to add on a Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act. We couldn't do it. 
   So this bill, at the end of the day, focuses on a small number of young women crossing State lines with an adult to get an abortion and ignores 800,000 pregnancies which could have been prevented. 
   We had our chance. We had our chance, but, oh no, it is going to be  about political correctness. It is going to be about rightwing ideology. Oh no, we can't do that. 
   This bill does nothing to increase communications between parents and teens. It does nothing to stop sexual predators. Most young women who become pregnant already turn to their parents for help. 
   This is a wonderful country. We have loving families, 
   for the most part, loving open families who say to their kids, as I certainly did to mine, and my husband did: Anything you have on your mind, you just come to us. You feel free to tell us. That is how it should be. 
   When I was a child, my mother said I could tell her anything, and I did. I told her anything. She loved me unconditionally and helped me through whatever problem I might have had. 
   With my own children, I tried to emulate my mother. I hope and I think I did that. They are now grown. They take care of me. 
   But what about young people who don't have that warm feeling in their families? What about the millions of victims of violence and abuse? This bill, as it is drafted, hurts just those victims. It doesn't mean to. That is not the purpose of it. But we have found out in our lives that some bills have unintended consequences, and this one sure does. 
   As this bill is drafted, a father who commits incest and takes his daughter over a State line--we are trying to fix it, and we hope we can fix it--that father has rights under this bill. It is an outrage. 
   Nearly half of pregnant teens who have been abused or assaulted are found to be abused and assaulted by a family member. That is the sad truth. Thirty percent of minors who don't tell their parents have experienced violence in the home. In other words, they are too fearful to go to the home where they have suffered violence. They fear violence or they worry that, in a rage, their parents will kick them out if they tell them they have become pregnant. 
   Don't we want them to be safe and secure? Don't we want them to have help from a caring adult? I would hope so. But under this bill, a clergy member who really cares about the family could be sued by parents who abuse their children. A loving grandma or a loving aunt could be sued. Oh, there are no exceptions allowed. 
   Senator Feinstein, unfortunately, is suffering from the flu and cannot be here today. She had an amendment--she cannot offer it--that would have exempted caring clergy and caring relatives. She couldn't be here. 
   This bill is so imperfect that I cannot begin to count the ways. 
   In my State, as I mentioned previously, parental notification laws have been voted down. In general, we all want to have adult consent. I believe it is important to help guide a young person through such a decision. But when we look at some of the unintended consequences of these bills and the fine print of these bills, we find that they are going to have the opposite effect of what we want. Instead of helping the minor, it puts her at risk. 
   We know some specific cases: A 12-year-old whose pediatrician discovered she was pregnant. It turned out the rapist was her stepfather and the mother wasn't living with the girl. The doctors recommended that her Aunt Vicki bring her to a specialist in a neighboring State. She was only 12 years old, the aunt said. It is bad enough to go through incest, but then to have a child from that incest. We should all agree that only the father should go to jail, not the caring relative, Aunt Vicki. 
   I know it is very difficult to talk about this topic, but some very sick people do rape. Fathers do rape, uncles do rape and even impregnate their daughters. 
   Look at these newspaper stories from around the country. 
   ``An American Tragedy.'' This is from The Oregonian:  
   A 13-year-old girl in Idaho whose father had impregnated her. ..... the morning she was supposed to have an abortion, her father, who admitted his guilt, walked into her room with a rifle ..... shot her in the head and then he shot himself.  
   How does this bill prevent that? This bill will frighten a girl, make her more alone because she can't go to a caring adult because a caring adult could be sued by a parent. So she is scared. She gets in a car. She drives over the State line by herself. She is all alone. The father finds out, grabs her. She has no protection. He shoots her, shoots himself. 
   What are we doing here? Why don't you look at what you are doing. Why don't you look at the practical impact of what you are doing? 
   Here is another: ``Teen Accuses Father of Rape,'' The Journal News, Westchester County, NY.  
   ..... man was arrested and charged with first degree rape of his teenage daughter. The man tried to force his daughter to take an unknown pill to cause a miscarriage because he believed she was pregnant.  
   This happens too often. 
   ``Father Sentenced for Raping Daughters,'' Newark Advocate:  
   Man convicted of raping his two daughters. ..... the girls were 13 and 17 at the time of the crimes.  
   ``Man Charged with Incest is Arrested in North Carolina'':  
   Police said a father raped and impregnated his 16-year-old daughter and raped his step-daughter who is mentally and physically disabled.  
   The way this bill has come to us from the committee protects the father. Senator Ensign and I are working hard--and I hope we can reach agreement--to solve the problems of this bill. But the way the bill passed the other body, they didn't pay any attention to this. Wonderful, we pass a bill that protects fathers who rape their daughter. It is basically a bill that, all of that incest aside, really will wind up in a young woman getting into a car on her own, frightened to death to tell her parents, and driving alone. 
   ``Ordeal Ended/Dad's Arrest Ends Years of Rape for Teen,'' Newsday.  
   For years, a convicted child sex offender used his Bronx home as a pornographic movie studio for sex videos of himself and his young daughter. The girl had tried at least once to alert someone--her mother ..... her mother took no action.  
   ``Her mother took no action.'' As Senator Ensign and I try to reach an agreement on an incest amendment, let me be clear: We are not going to reach that mother. I, if I go along with this, am giving up a lot of my amendment. This is still an imperfect bill, and I will show you in a checklist my amendment versus the Ensign amendment and what we try to do in our amendment. 
   The Ensign amendment, as was originally proposed--we support it--stops a father who has raped his daughter from suing the trusted adult who helped his daughter end the resulting pregnancy. We applaud that amendment, and that amendment will hopefully be adopted. 
   But we don't stop with that because the Ensign amendment doesn't go far enough. We want to stop a father who has raped his daughter from exercising any parental consent rights. We want to stop all criminal prosecution or jail time for a trusted adult who helps a victim of incest. 
   Imagine under this bill a child goes running to a nextdoor neighbor whom she loves, a kind of an aunt to her, and she says: Please help me, please help me. 
   I am pregnant. My father raped me. I can't go in that house. I can't tell my mother. My mother won't believe me. The nextdoor neighbor helps her. Under this bill the mother and the father can sue. We have to fix that. We are not going to fix it today. We can't reach all of what I am trying to do because I can't get agreement on the other side. It is still going to be an awful problem. 
   We also stop a father who has raped his daughter, or any other family member who has committed incest against a minor, from transporting her across State lines to obtain an abortion. 
   We don't want these perpetrators of incest to take their victims across the State line. We are working hard under the parameters of this bill to address the issue of incest. 
   At the end of the day, if our negotiations go well, we will have taken care of two of the five Boxer provisions. Will I be happy that these three provisions are not taken care of? No. I am not happy. It is outrageous that we can't get it all done. So be it. Let the people judge. But we will do as much as we can to improve this bill. 
   This bill as written protects the rights of brutal fathers. There are not many out there, but there are some. 
   There is only one thing that we can do to make matters worse than parental consent: that is giving these sexual predators more power over their children to keep on perpetrating these acts  and then saying they know how to handle it. They can handle it. Just take a child in the car and go. 
   The bill as written actually forces some young incest victims to get permission from their rapist fathers to get an abortion. Can you imagine? We have to fix that. And it allows the predator fathers to take their daughters across State lines. 
   We are trying hard to reach an agreement to take care of this problem. I am grateful that we may get two-fifths of the way there on my amendment. 
   I will work hard if this bill becomes law to fix this bill. I will introduce legislation to fix this bill. I will also prepare legislation that goes further than this and says if someone is a victim of rape and they are fearful of telling their parents, that parent, adult, or grandma can't be sued. 
   We really have a long way to go. This bill has many problems. It sends a message to young girls: Go it alone. Avoid all of this. Get in your car and go it alone. Don't take anyone with you. If you get in trouble at your moment of need, this bill says go it alone. She can go across the State line on her own. This bill doesn't do anything about it--only if she has a parent with her to help her. 
   I believe this bill is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has been clear that abortion restrictions must not impose an undue burden on women, and they must include a health exception. There is no health exception in this bill. If a doctor takes a girl across State lines because he worries about her health, and if she doesn't get an abortion right away and faces paralysis or faces infertility, there is no exception in this bill. The doctor can be sued. 
   What kind of message are we sending to young women? Go it alone. What kind of message are we sending to fathers who commit incest or mothers who turn a blind eye to it? Oh, don't worry. You are protected. Maybe Boxer will get two of her provisions, but we are not going to give you the five. I thought it was one nation under God, indivisible. 
   I didn't think when we cross over State lines we are going to have the pregnancy police look in our cars. This is unconstitutional. You don't have to carry the laws of your own State on your back. If you go through another State and there is a speed limit that is different than the one you live in, you obey the laws of the State you are in. That is the law you carry on your back, not the State you left. No one could go gambling in Nevada if we said: If you live in Tennessee and no gambling is allowed, you can't go gamble in Nevada because you will be arrested by the police at the border. 
   There are different criminal acts and different penalties in different States. Some have tough laws. We know that. States have rights. 
   We find it interesting how someone only supports the States when they agree with them. But if they don't agree with that State's law, then they try to force another State's law onto the State with which they disagree. I don't know of any other law in history, with the exception of the Fugitive Slave Act, that has required citizens to carry the laws of their own State on their backs. That was back in the days of slavery. If you ran away to another State, you were still stolen property until the court said no. 
   If you look at the constitutionality issue, if you look at the fact that victims of rape are left in deep trouble, as are victims of incest, if you look at the fact that good, kind, loving people like grandmas and grandfathers could go to jail for helping their granddaughter--no matter how you look at this bill, I believe you should come to the conclusion that this bill has major problems. 
   Parental consent--you know something, Senator Ensign is right. People support the idea that a parent should be contacted by their child and talked to when a child has an unintended pregnancy. We want that so much. I want that so much. 
   I also want kids to know they could talk to their grandma, they could talk to their grandpa, they could talk to their clergy, they could get help when they need it. 
   I don't believe the American people support throwing grandma in jail because she embraced her granddaughter and said: My God, I am worried that your parents, your dad might hurt you if you tell the truth. She throws her arms around the granddaughter and protects her and helps her through a crisis. 
   I believe stopping an abortion is worth preventing a teen from having a lifetime of paralysis, infertility, or worse, and yet there is no health exception in this bill. I think people want us to stop using this issue as a political football. 
   I know who brought this up. It is brought up by the other side of the aisle every time we have an election. 
   I hope we can join hands to stop teen pregnancies. We had a chance to do it. But no, we had a vote and we lost that vote. It is unreal. We got a couple of Republicans, but not enough. 
   I hope the American people are watching this debate. If our goal is to help our young people--and that is the stated goal--there are a lot of ways we could help rather than scaring them to death and making them go it alone in a desperate situation, making criminals of their grandmas and their grandpas and their clergy. 
   I am sad that the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act didn't pass as part of this bill. It would have made this bill better. I am glad that we are going to have some coming together on the incest amendment, although as I said, it is only going to take care of two of the five problems we have relating to the bill. But at least we are making a bit of progress. 
   The bill, to me, is blatantly unconstitutional. It violates our core principles of federalism. It puts caring adults in jail and endangers the health and lives of our most vulnerable teens. On that basis it ought to be defeated. 
   I believe this bill will pass. I also believe our incest amendment will pass. I think that is important. We should have two votes on that. I think it is important to have those recorded votes so that the message goes to the House that their bill blatantly helps the predators. I call it the ``Incest Predators Protection Act.'' Thank you very much. I know my time is up. I yield the remainder of my time at this time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, again, for the benefit of our colleagues, we are waiting patiently to have the amendment we agreed on to come before us. Then we are hoping at the right time, Senator Ensign will make a unanimous consent request for a vote on an amendment we have agreed on, and then vote on final passage. So hopefully we will have that done very soon. As soon as it is done, I will yield the floor and allow the Senator, the good Senator from Nevada, to make his unanimous consent request. 
   The Senator from Nevada wants to protect our daughters. He is a dad of a daughter. I am a mom of a daughter. I want to protect our daughters. So let's not get confused on this point. We all want to protect our daughters. We all adore them. We want them to be safe, and we want them to get the help they need. We want them healthy. We want them well. We do not want them afraid. 
   But I do fear that this bill, the way it is drafted--and, yes, we are going to make a little bit of a correction on the incest part, but not as much as we should, but some--we are going to make some progress, and I am grateful for that. Basically, the way this bill is drafted, it is going to frighten our daughters because here is the way it works, folks: If you are a young woman in a parental notification State, you will take matters into your own hands because you are too frightened to go to your parents. 
   Now, we all hope all parents will be open and loving and caring and helpful and will be able to be approached when a young woman becomes pregnant and it is an unintended pregnancy. We would hope and pray that family, that loving family, will sit around and talk about what ought to happen here, what is the best thing for everybody. I am pro-choice. I am for whatever the family decides. If they decide that the best thing is to raise that child in the family, that is their choice. If they decide  it is best if the young woman exercises her right to choose, which is her right in this country--and has been since 1973--she has that right. 
   That is what we hope happens, that there will be these conversations. Of course, my friends on the other side of the aisle do not want a choice. They want to force her to have the child. They are against Roe v. Wade, but that is another debate. That is a debate we take to the people, and that is a debate that the pro-choice people win. They do not want Senator Boxer or Senator Ensign involved in that family discussion, saying: But, no, you must have this child. You must not have any rights to choose. They do not want that. People do not feel comfortable with it. They want to deal with this their own way, with their own God, with their own family, with their loving family members. But that is not before us. 
   What is before us is a very narrow bill that deals with a very narrow circumstance where there is a young woman who does not go to her parents, mostly because she is scared to death to go to them. For whatever reasons, in her mind, she is fearful: Will they--if she is from a violent home--beat her up? Will they hurt her? Will they verbally abuse her? Will they be disappointed? And that weighs on her. 
   So what we are saying with this bill to that girl in a parental notification State is: You are alone. You can't go to anyone else. You can't go to your grandma who you adore, you can't go to your grandpa, you can't go to your big sister, you can't go to your Aunt Susan, you can't go to your clergy who has taken care of you and looked after you. 
   So you can't go to your doctor. You can't do this because they could be sued and put in jail. That is what this bill does. Is that America? Rather than go to the people who she knows who adore her, love her, care about her, would counsel her, would help her and, perhaps, by the way, talk her into speaking to her parents or going with her to speak to her parents, this bill says: Go it alone, get in your car, get in an airplane, don't take anyone with you, don't tell anyone else, because that person can be sued and, worse, put in jail. 
   These are our kids. My God, what a situation. And somehow this is supposed to be a wonderful thing we are doing, a family-values thing we are doing. I don't think you can force families into these situations. We don't know enough to be able to do that. There will be unintended consequences. We will have suicides. We will have very serious problems. 
   As we wait around here in these last moments of this debate--and I am hopeful we can bring it to a close--let me say again that I thank Senator Ensign for coming my way, not quite halfway, on the issue of incest. Because the bill as written allowed a father who raped his daughter to have all kinds of parental rights: the right to sign an agreement that she could have an abortion, the right to take her over State lines, the right to sue a loving and caring adult who helped her. 
   I wish to show this chart which I have shown previously. Under this amendment we are hoping is coming to us momentarily, we will stop a father who has raped his daughter from suing the trusted adult who helped his daughter end the resulting pregnancy. So in the case of incest, if the child goes to grandma, the incestuous father cannot sue grandma. 
   Then, at the end, Senator Ensign was not willing to take these three provisions which I will debate. He did take my last provision. 
   We now stop a father who has raped his daughter or any other family member who has committed incest against a minor from transporting her across State lines to obtain an abortion. That would be a crime. 
   The three things that are not done, which is why I think this amendment falls short: we haven't stopped a father who has raped his daughter from exercising parental consent rights; we haven't stopped all criminal prosecution or jail time for a trusted adult who helped a victim of incest; and we haven't stopped all civil suits against a trusted adult who helped a victim of incest. But we have taken care of two issues. For that I am grateful because this bill will become law. It will be sent to the President, who will sign it. Unlike his veto on the stem cell bill, which he should have signed, because that bill would help our families, help our children with juvenile diabetes, help grandmas and grandpas with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, help our youngsters who were paralyzed--he vetoed that. He will sign this one. 
   This is a political bill. It did come to us in 1998 just before the election. Let's face facts. We know when it came. 
   My friend from Nevada is right when he says people support parental notification. They do want to believe we could all to go our parents with these problems. But let me tell you what they don't want. They don't want to give incest predators any rights whatsoever. They would want to make an exception in this bill for rape victims so that if you are a victim of rape and you were too scared to tell your parents, you could go to your grandmother, but not under this bill. A victim of rape, you are too scared to tell your parents because of the circumstances--maybe it was date rape, maybe you just can't explain it. Maybe you are frightened to death. You go to your grandma. She could be sued by the parents and she could be put in jail by the Federal Government. Send your grandma to jail. That is what we are doing here today. Why? Because she loved her granddaughter, because she was there for her granddaughter, and because by stepping in, she may have really saved a tragedy from occurring. 
   I don't believe the American people want us to be this radical. I think they would have wanted us to do more exceptions to this bill. Seventy percent of the American people oppose abortion laws that put people in jail. I don't believe Americans think that stopping an abortion is worth causing a teen a lifetime of paralysis, infertility, or worse. This bill, if it does get signed into law, and I say it will, and unless it is overturned by the courts, which I think it might be, but if it isn't, it basically will put these young women in a situation where they feel the world is closing in on them. That is not right. 
   I will close my debate and urge a ``yes'' vote on the Boxer-Ensign amendment that will go part way toward solving the predator incest issue. Then I would urge a ``no'' vote on the underlying bill because of all the problems it creates that we have not been able to address. 
   I thank the staffs on both sides. We have had a long and difficult day, emotional issues for us all. Yet we have handled it in such a way that I am hopeful that momentarily we will have a unanimous consent request to resolve the procedures governing the rest of the evening. 
   I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Ensign. I had an amendment to solve this incest predator problem. He came to me almost halfway. We didn't quite get there, but it is a start. Again, for the benefit of my colleagues, two out of five provisions I wanted are in this amendment. This amendment stops a father who has raped his daughter from suing the trusted adult who helped his daughter end the resulting pregnancy, and it stops a father who has raped his daughter or any other family member who has committed incest against a minor from transporting her across State lines. This is an improvement. The reason we want to have a vote on it is because we hope it is a strong statement going into the conference on this bill. Again, we still need to fix many more provisions of this bill. 
   I believe, at the end of the day, it doesn't make our teenagers any safer. It will make them fearful. It will make them feel alone. I think the bill is unconstitutional. I hope we have some ``no'' votes to send a message that this bill needs a lot more work. 
   I thank Senator Ensign and his staff and my staff. It has been a tough day.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Clinton. I am also very proud to be on the floor of this great body with my Democratic women Senate colleagues. 
   We held a press conference in which we challenged the Republican leadership to bring up issues on this floor that are meaningful to our families. Here is our checklist for change. Each of us has taken one of these issues. Mine happens to be protecting our air, land, and water. 
   The message we are here today to convey is that the Republicans run the Senate, the White House, and the House of Representatives. They control what issues come to the floor of the Congress for debate. We spent yesterday debating an amendment to the Constitution to ban flag burning. We also debated a bipartisan proposal by Senators Bennett and Clinton to ban flag burning via a statute. 
   Every one of us in this body voted to ban flag burning, be it by a statute or by an amendment. But one has to ask the question: Is that debate, which we have had four times, more important than the issues that are on our checklist for change? 
   There have been four reports of flag burnings this year. That is four too many, but they were four. Yet there are 44 million Americans whose pensions are at risk while this Congress fails to act to protect those pensions. 
   Four flags burned versus 7.5 million Americans who have been denied an increase in the minimum wage. And this Congress, under the Republicans, sees nothing wrong with giving themselves a pay raise, but they can't raise the minimum wage, and it has been flat for 9 years, which means it has gone down in value and people cannot make it on $5.15 an hour. 
   Four flags have been burned--four too many--versus 170,000 talented college-ready students each year who stay home because they can't afford tuition. 
   Four flags burned--four too many--yet 30,000-plus veterans have waited in 2006 for their first medical appointment, an issue that will be taken up by Senator Murray. 
   Four flags burned versus 200,000 people in New Orleans living in trailers, unfinished houses, or tents in the front yards of their Katrina-ravaged homes. 
   Four flags burned this year--four too many--versus $2.89 a gallon for regular gas. By the way, that is the national price. In California, we are looking at well over $3 a gallon. 
   Four flags burned--four too many--versus 46 million Americans with no health insurance, and Senator Lincoln will talk about that.  
   Four flags burned--four too many--versus over 500,000 Americans who have lost their lives while we wait for this Republican Congress to take action on stem cell legislation, an issue that has been championed by many of us in this Senate and on this checklist carried by Senator Feinstein. 
   And, finally, four flags burned--four too many--versus 75 million Americans living near our most polluted toxic waste Superfund sites. 
   In conclusion, because my checkpoint is protect our air, land, and water, I call on this Republican Congress to address two pressing environmental crises: global warming and Superfund cleanup. 
   It is easy to put global warming on the back burner as long as our everyday lives are not affected, but some people think their everyday lives are beginning to be affected. The best scientists in the world warn us that we are near the tipping point on global warming. 
   Just the other day, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, along with the national academy of science for 10 other nations, agreed that climate change is real and it has to be addressed. So we call on this Republican Congress to do something about it. Don't sit back and say this doesn't exist because you are ignoring science. 
   I am proud to say that in the State of California, they are listening. This week a historic global warming bill cleared the first hurdle and passed the California Senate Environmental Quality Committee. California has been a leader in the environment, and Senator Feinstein and I want to make sure that we can bring some of that action right here to the Senate. 
   Last point: We need to clean up these Superfund sites that are hurting our families and hurting our communities. Under the Clinton administration, we cleaned up 80 of these sites a year. Now it is down to 40 sites a year. We owe our children a clean and healthy environment. 
   Mr. President, it is time for you and the Members of the Republican Congress to call on the Republican leadership to take up our checklist for change. We are very proud to be talking about this all together this morning on the Senate floor. 
   I am proud to yield now for Senator Patty Murray of Washington.

    Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia. 
   Mr. Kavanaugh's lack of experience, partisan ideological leanings, lack of judicial temperament, and refusal to adequately answer questions posed by the Judiciary Committee make him unqualified to sit on the second highest court in the country. 
   Mr. Kavanaugh is a young lawyer who has spent most of his career in partisan positions. He lacks substantive courtroom experience and has never tried a case to a verdict. In fact, a judge before whom he appeared characterized Mr. Kavanaugh work as ``less than adequate'' and at the experience level of an associate. 
   Nor is Mr. Kavanaugh a noted legal scholar. The highlight of his career has been working with Kenneth Starr in the Office of the Solicitor General and at the Office of the Independent Counsel, where he spent 4 years and coauthored the infamous Starr Report. 
   Upon further review the nonpartisan American Bar Association panel downgraded Mr. Kavanaugh's rating from ``well-qualified'' to ``qualified.'' He was described by interviewees as ``sanctimonious,'' and ``immovable and very stubborn and frustrating to deal with on some issues.'' These are not qualities that make for a good judge. His low rating and nonjudicious demeanor put him in stark contrast to the majority of appointments to the DC Circuit who received ``well-qualified'' ratings and respectful reviews from the American Bar Association review panel. 
   The President can and should do better than this. The country deserves better than this.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I listen to my distinguished chairman, and I wonder who he is actually talking about when he says there is so much support for John Bolton. There has been an unprecedented outcry of Republicans and Democrats against this nomination. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the votes on U.S. ambassadors at the United Nations since 1945.

   Mrs. BOXER. What this will show for the record is that starting in 1945, we have had voice votes and unanimous consent votes on almost all of these nominees. There were few exceptions. Andrew Young got the post 89 to 2; Donald McHenry, 83 to nothing--so they had votes--Jeane Kirkpatrick, 81 to nothing. The largest ``no'' vote was Richard Holbrooke, who had 16 against him. Bill Richardson was 100 to nothing; John Negroponte, voice vote; Danforth, voice vote. 
   I am putting this in the RECORD because when you listen to my friends who are supporting John Bolton, you would think that this is just a run-of-the-mill type appointment, that it is usual to have this kind of firestorm. Nothing could be further from the truth. This nomination is a diversion from the consensus candidates that we have had in the past. Since my chairman talked about all the support John Bolton has, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD in a letter dated May 9, 2005.

   Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to have an additional 5 minutes. I will close down in 3 minutes. 
   So we have reason after reason after reason here. Senator Voinovich laid out the record. He read from the record. I am going to close with something I hope every single Member of this Senate will listen to. John Bolton did not tell the truth to the committee. I am going to repeat that. John Bolton did not tell the truth to the Foreign Relations Committee. He said he shrugged off the issue. He shrugged off the issue with these people he tried to fire. He said he just dropped by the CIA on his way home from work. He said he didn't try to dish out retribution or try to fire anybody at all. He said a lot of things that weren't true to our committee. And that is very serious. He wasn't truthful with us. He didn't give us honest accounts. He didn't tell us the truth about how he tried on many occasions to fire these analysts. And if nothing else I have said matters about the retribution, about the twisting of arms to get intelligence to build up a phony case against other countries, if the fact that he said there was no United Nations doesn't move you, or if that 10 stories were gone it wouldn't matter, if you don't care anything about that, I think you ought to care about telling the truth before a committee of the Senate. And we have had chapter and verse. We have it cold here. 
   For all those reasons, I hope we will not vote for John Bolton. And if we do not get the information Senators BIDEN and DODD are pushing so hard for, we should delay this until we see that information because it is a matter of right and wrong. It is right for us to get that information. It is wrong for the administration to withhold it. We are a separate but equal branch with the White House. 
   I thank my colleagues. I know this was a long statement, but this is a very important issue. And it is not just one reason against John Bolton; there are about six. I hope I have laid them out. 
   I thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing ``The Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2005'' to ensure that our Nation's pharmacies fill all valid prescriptions without unnecessary delay or interference. 
   We are hearing more and more stories about pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions for contraceptives because of their personal beliefs, not their medical concerns. Some of my constituents have told me about their experiences. One woman in Merced County was turned away by a pharmacist who said ``we don't do that here,'' but, less than two hours later, another pharmacist in the store filled the same prescription for another customer immediately. It's not just in California, of course. 
   In Menomonie, WI, a pharmacist told a woman he wouldn't fill her prescription for birth control pills or even transfer her prescription to another pharmacy. In Fabens, TX, a married woman had just had a baby. It had been a C-section. Her doctor told her not to get pregnant again in the near future, and prescribed birth control pills. She went to get her prescription refilled while visiting her mother in Fabens. Unfortunately, the cashier told her that the pharmacist wouldn't be able to refill her prescription because birth control was ``against his religion'' and was a form of ``abortion.'' 
   The American people do not think this is right. According to a November 2004 CBS/New York Times poll, 8 out of 10 Americans believe that pharmacists should not be permitted to refuse to dispense birth control pills, including 70 percent of Republicans. They know that contraceptives are a legal and effective way to reduce unintended pregnancies and abortions. 
   But this challenge is not just about contraceptives. It's about access to health care. It's about making decisions based on science and medicine. Tomorrow, pharmacists could refuse to dispense any drug for any medical condition. Access to pharmaceuticals should depend on medical judgments, not personal ideology. 
   The Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act requires pharmacies that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding to fill all valid prescriptions for FDA-approved drugs and devices without unnecessary delay or interference. That means, if the item is not in stock, the pharmacy should order it according to its standard procedures, or, if the customer prefers, transfer it to another pharmacy or give the prescription back. 
   There are medical reasons why a pharmacy wouldn't want to fill prescriptions including problems with dosages, harmful interactions with other drugs, or potential drug abuse. This bill would not interfere with those decisions. 
   I know some are concerned about those pharmacists who do not want to dispense particular medications because of their personal beliefs, including their religious values. I believe that is between the pharmacist and his or her employer. In this bill, it is the responsibility of the pharmacy, not the pharmacist, to ensure that prescriptions are filled. Pharmacies can accommodate their employees in any manner that they wish as long as customers get their medications without delay, interference, or harassment. 
   Most of our pharmacies receive reimbursements through Medicaid. When the prescription drug program goes into full effect in January, a growing number will be part of Medicare. If a pharmacy contracts with our Medicaid or Medicare programs, directly or indirectly, they should fulfill their fundamental duty to the patients they serve. 
   Most pharmacists work hard and do right by their patients every day. They believe in science. They believe that if a doctor writes a valid prescription, it should be filled. But, unfortunately, some have put their personal views over the health of their patients. That is wrong. When people walk into a pharmacy, they should have confidence that they will get the medications they need, when they need them. The Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2005 will help ensure just that.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I say to my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, how much I appreciate his leadership in the area of health care. His analysis of where we stand on the stem cell issue is so appropriate, and he is so right. Here we have a whole area of scientific research that is waiting to take off. We have States, such as mine and others, that are taking the lead instead of following the lead of the Federal Government. 
   I say to my friend, does he ever remember a time in history when this country was plagued by disease that the Federal Government didn't step to the plate, whether there was a Republican President or a Democratic President? Isn't it shocking that as we face these epidemics of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and cancer and heart disease and all the others my friend mentioned, isn't it amazing--I am sure it is to him as well as to me--that we have a lack of leadership in Washington?

If we asked for a show of hands in any roomful of people: Have you been touched by cancer, have you not personally or someone you know been touched by heart disease, by stroke, by Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, paralysis, all these things, we know how many hands would go up.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am very proud of my State. 
   In my State the gentleman who took the lead in putting the stem cell research initiative on the ballot has a child with juvenile diabetes. Watching that child suffer and struggle motivated him. He ignited this wonderful movement in our State. Shockingly, here we are in Health Week and this thing is nowhere to be seen. It is another example of why we need change around this place. I thank my friend. 
   This Health Week Republican style is really fascinating when you look at the bills that have come before us. The first two bills would have hurt patients who were injured by malpractice, patients who might have been made infertile or harmed in many ways. Those two bills took away the rights of patients.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Dorgan's remarks. I have been on the floor of the Senate a lot today waiting to get the time, and I have been fortunate to hear many colleagues. I thank him for very succinctly pointing out that in a real health care week you wouldn't close your eyes to hope--hope that we are going to find cures for the terrible diseases that plague our families--Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, stroke, heart attack, you just name them. The fact is, we know stem cell research is promising. We know a lot of States have gotten out ahead of the Federal Government because this President and this Congress have restricted the number of stem cell lines we can fund research on. And many of those stem cell lines are, frankly, no good at all because they have been impacted by mice cells. And they lack the diversity needed for robust research. 
   I have talked to leaders in this field. I am not a scientist. I was educated in economics. But I have spoken to leading scientists, among whom is a gentleman named Dr. Peterson who worked at USFC in San Francisco. He is one of the leading pioneers in stem cell research who left to go to England because this President and this Congress put up a big stop sign in front of stem cell research. It is tragic. 
   Our families need the hope of a cure. How many of us have met with these youngsters who have juvenile diabetes, and we have seen how difficult their lives are and how they suffer, even with the strides that have been made in this area. They are still in great danger. 
   Health Week is here. We have a vehicle, as Senator Dorgan calls it, the Enzi bill, which tries to deal with the health insurance problems that small businesses face. I am going to talk about a better alternative to the Enzi  bill that will really do something. But we also have a chance to raise these issues during the debate on the Enzi bill. 
   We have bipartisan support for drug importation from countries such as Canada, where drugs are sold at half the price of what drug companies charge in the U.S. We have bipartisan support for stem cell research, fixing the Medicare prescription drug issue so we could actually say to 
   Medicare: You have the ability and the right just as the VA has to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies for lower prices. But I have to say Health Care Week Republican style is really Insurance Company Week. 
   If you look at the bills that have been brought before us, they all help the insurance companies. They don't help average Americans. They do not help us. 
   The first two bills said we are going to restrict the right of patients--whether they are very wealthy, whether they are middle income, whether they are poor--we are going to stop them from recovering damages if they are harmed by medical malpractice. 
   I was very pleased that the Senate chose not to limit debate on those two bills which would have taken away the rights of patients while giving a gift to the insurance companies. And hopefully we can change the Enzi bill. 
   I don't like bills that take away benefits from my people in California. I don't like bills that take away benefits from all Americans. That is why the Enzi bill is a bad bill. It does just that. I will go through with you the list of benefits that are taken away. 
   Mr. President, the Republicans bring us Health Care Week. They bring us the Enzi bill. What they do not tell us and you don't find out until you look is that all the States' protections that have been put into place will be wiped out upon passage of the Enzi bill. 
   Those are harsh words. What do I mean? What benefits will be taken away from my people in California? According to the report put together by Families U.S.A, ``The Enzi Bill, Bad Medicine for America,'' those benefits include AIDS vaccines, alcoholism treatment, blood lead screening. You know that is important because if you don't screen kids for lead in their blood they could have learning disabilities--bone density screening. We know about osteoporosis. In California we guarantee that your insurance will pay for that; no guarantee in the Enzi bill whatsoever. As a matter of fact, the Enzi bill overrides all of this--cervical cancer screening, clinical trials, colorectal screening, contraceptives, diabetic supplies and education. 
   We just talked about how it is so important for diabetics to have their meds--drug abuse treatment, emergency services, home health care, hospice care, infertility treatment, mammography screening, maternity care, mental health parity. 
   In my State, if you have a mental health problem and you need help, your insurance coverage will cover your treatment, just the same as if you had a physical problem. We know it works. The list goes on--metabolic disorders, minimal mastectomy, off-label drug use. In California, we have a law that says you can't kick a woman out of a hospital the same day she has a mastectomy. What, you may say? This happens? It does--off-label drug use, orthotics, prosthetics, prostate cancer screening. We know that prostate cancer is a scourge--reconstructive surgery, second medical surgery opinion. 
   If somebody tells you you need serious surgery, you can get a second opinion in California. That is covered--special footwear, telemedicine, well child care, so that we prevent diseases. That is my State. 
   Every single State in the Union gets overridden, whether it is Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho. 
   I know my friend from Georgia would be interested because he is sitting in the Chair. These are the things that your State offers. It protects your consumers. It is as long a list as California, I am proud to say--alcoholism treatment, ambulatory surgery, bone density screening, bone marrow transplants are covered in the State of Georgia. Cervical cancer screening, contraceptives, dental anesthesia, diabetic supplies, drug abuse treatment, emergency services, heart transplants are covered in Georgia. Infertility treatment, mammography screening, mental health parity, minimal mastectomy stay, morbid obesity care--which is very important now with the obesity epidemic--off-label drug use, ovarian cancer screening, telemedicine, and well child care. Georgia has a very inclusive and wonderful list of guaranteed protections for people. 
   In the State of Georgia there are 2.347 million people affected by this who would not have those guarantees under the Enzi plan. The Enzi plan essentially says to insurance companies: You can choose. You have to offer one plan. What do they call that plan? One premium plan. You have to offer one premium plan based on a state plan of their choosing, but there is no guarantee at all that what is in that premium plan is what is in the Georgia plan or the California plan or the North Dakota plan. 
   The fact is, all of the work that has been done in our States--and I find it somewhat amusing given this is a Republican debate, that the Republican bill preempts the States. What is wrong with this picture? I thought our Republican friends loved decisionmaking at the State level. 
   No, not here in the Senate. They would prefer the insurance companies decide it rather than the States. 
   This is why I call my colleagues' attention to a study done on the impact on all the States, with letters compiled from attorneys general from many of the States and Governors. 
   From Oregon, they register their opposition, first their benefits are not guaranteed any longer. In addition, they are very worried about what happens to premiums. The Enzi bill disadvantages older people. As far as the research I have done, it disadvantages women. It certainly disadvantages people who come in with a preexisting condition such as high blood pressure. That includes a lot of Americans. 
   The bottom line is, the Enzi bill, the star rollout production of the Republican Health Care Week, will make null and void all protections that our States have given their citizens and replace them with some kind of riverboat gamble where insurers will choose some plan, from some State, and apply it to my State. I don't want a so-called premium plan from another State. 
   Here is a good example. In Connecticut, there is a terrible epidemic of Lyme disease. A tick bites your body and it can make a person very ill. We have some of that in California, but we do not have as much per capita as Connecticut. In Connecticut, the State legislature and the Governor say insurers have to cover Lyme disease because it is an epidemic in the State. In other States, it may not be necessary. However, we will wipe that Connecticut requirement off the books, and we will say, through the Enzi bill, insurance companies are going to decide. 
   Something is wrong. This is not Health Care Week, this is ``insurance company week.'' That is not good for consumers. 
   My own State has built a comprehensive State health insurance system that encourages affordable and equitable coverage for all, while ensuring consumers are protected and guaranteed benefits. The Enzi bill takes away a State's power to regulate health insurance. It is a gift to the insurers, as I said. It preempts benefits, as I said. It also is going to lead to way higher premiums for all in America who are covered by health insurance. 
   Insurance companies, not the States, will now decide what benefits the consumers. That is why we have letter after letter after letter from Governors, from attorneys general, warning us not to pass the Enzi bill. 
   There appears to be no limits on the cost shares an insurer can charge nor are there requirements that plans treat consumers equitably or offer comprehensive coverage. 
   As I said, if you are a little older--maybe you have high blood pressure, maybe you have some other health problems--you are in trouble. You are not going to have an affordable plan and you will lose the benefits you have. You may be priced out of the market. It will be catastrophic. 
   We have serious problems with the Enzi bill. Here is the great news. There is a wonderful alternative out there, the Durbin-Lincoln bill, of which I am a cosponsor. I thank my friends for working so hard on this. 
   As I go around my State, people nod in agreement with the Durbin-Lincoln bill's premise. Senators have very good  health insurance. We pay half of the premium and the Government matches the other half. There is a Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. There are basic benefits required and private companies come in and offer various plans. People such as me and my employees can choose from a broad array of plans. It works beautifully. 
   I ask unanimous consent, at 5:45, the Senator from Oregon, Senator Murray, be recognized for 15 minutes, until 6 o'clock.

   Mrs. BOXER. Senators Durbin and Lincoln take this Federal plan and open it up to small businesses with 100 employees down to a single self-employed person. 
   This plan will work because there will be a huge pool set up. Everyone can buy into it from any business in this country with less than 100 employees. It would be a very diverse pool of people. They will be insured. The pricing is going to be very fair and reasonable. The plan will be administered in the same way our Federal benefits are administered. 
   I heard Senator Thune say: That is a government plan. No, it isn't. It is a plan that is administered by the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, but it is coverage provided by private insurers. Because the administrative costs are kept so low, this is going to be very affordable and will solve the problem. 
   And guess what. This alternative, the Durbin-Lincoln alternative, does not take away the protections States have given all who live in those States. If you are in California, you still get the benefits. By law, you are protected. If you live in Washington State, you will get those benefits. The alternative that the Democrats are behind will cost less. It will protect benefits. It will work beautifully. 
   I say to my colleagues, if it is good enough for you, it ought to be good enough for small businesses and their employees. This bill is a wonderful and practical alternative. 
   In my concluding 6 or 7 minutes, I will say that this so-called Health Care Week is a major disappointment, unless we find out tomorrow we can amend the Enzi bill. If we can amend Enzi and pass stem cell research and prescription drug reimportation, if we can make sure there is hope for patients with Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart condition, stroke, cancer because we move ahead with science, then Health Care Week will have mattered. If we can offer the Durbin-Lincoln substitute, it will not preempt the protections of State law as the Enzi bill does. The Enzi bill has more opposition than any bill I remember. AARP is against it. The Cancer Foundation is against it. There are 224 organizations against it.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this bill is going to hurt American health care by cancelling out all the hard-won State protections and by raising premiums so high they will price consumers out of the market. That is why across the board there is opposition. I have not seen this many organizations come out against a bill. 
   By the way, this bill, when it was first presented, sounded reasonable. It was only when we looked at the small print that we realized how dangerous it is. 
   Instead of working on this misguided bill, we could have done the alternative, we could have done the stem cell, we could have fixed the Medicare prescription drugs, we could have allowed drug importation. 
   If we didn't want to do real health care reform, there are a lot of other things we could have done, such as raise the minimum wage. We could have finished the job on immigration reform, strengthening the enforcement at the border and stopping illegal immigration, but getting people on a path and out of the shadows. 
   What about Superfund sites? We have some of the most polluted sites in the country still awaiting cleanup. We have one in four people in America, including 10 million children, living within 4 miles of a Superfund site. 
   What about debating the war Iraq? That is on everyone's mind. There is still no exit strategy. There is still no plan. We see suffering on the ground there every single day. 
   We have issues with a potential nuclear Iran. We should debate that. In Afghanistan, the situation is deteriorating and we have all but forgotten about it. We have not followed the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission to this date. We have failed fiscal policies. We have debt as far as the eye can see. We ought to debate pay-as-you-go. If Members want to spend money, they should show how they going to pay for it instead of putting the burden on the backs of America's children. 
   There are many other things we could do, but since we are on Health Care Week, let's fix our health care system. Let's not pass a bill that will not help people with serious diseases or fix the problems with the Medicare prescription drug program. 
   We have so much work to do and this Enzi bill is masquerading as a bill that will help our citizens. When we read the fine print, we find out it is only going to make matters worse. 
   I am proud to yield the floor to my friend from Washington.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coburn for his work on this amendment. I am very pleased to be a cosponsor. 
   As he explains, this amendment will stop the Export-Import Bank from financing a project to construct nuclear powerplants in China. Earlier this year, the Ex-Im Bank agreed to provide $5 billion in loans or loan guarantees to the American subsidiary of a British company, Westinghouse Electric Company, so the company could bid on a contract to build nuclear powerplants in China. 
   This deal will, if we do not stop it, be the largest deal in the history of the Ex-Im Bank. In fact, it would be nearly  three times larger than the bank's previous deal, a $1.7 billion transaction in the mid-1980s. So this is not some small, inconsequential amendment. This is a big deal because this would be the biggest deal of the Ex-Im Bank since the 1980s, and three times the size of that deal. According to the Ex-Im Bank itself, some of these loans may go not to the company but directly to the Government of China. What is going on here? 
   Over the last decade, China has emerged as an economic power. It is the sixth largest economy in the world with a gross domestic product of over $1.65 trillion. The economy is growing at 9.5 percent. 
   What about our economic relationship with China? Last year, the United States had a trade deficit of $162 billion with China. This year, the trade deficit may go over $200 billion. This is in part because China purposely undervalued its currency in order to dump projects in America. 
   Just last month, a company that is majority-owned by the Chinese Government offered to buy the American company, Unocol, for $18.5 billion. In addition--and this shocks me every time I read it--the Chinese Government owns $230 billion of our Treasury bonds on which we are paying billions of dollars of interest. The Chinese Government is not poor, and it does not need a loan backed by U.S. taxpayers. 
   What would that $5 billion loan be used for? It would be used to help Westinghouse build nuclear powerplants in China, one of the riskiest investments possible. Remember, as Senator Coburn has explained, Westinghouse is the American subsidiary of a large British company. 
   Since 1948, in the United States the nuclear power industry has received more than $66 billion of Federal research and development funding. I am the first to say, the majority of Senators support these types of subsidies. Why? Because we have not seen a nuclear powerplant built in America since 1973. Why? Because it is too risky an investment. But the Ex-Im Bank is prepared to put our American taxpayer dollars at risk for nuclear powerplants in China. Nuclear power is not only a risky investment here, but think about nuclear powerplants being built in China where the terribly weak standards on workplace safety glare out at us and the terribly weak standards of environmental protection stand out. That in itself takes the risk to a whole new level. 
   There are several other aspects of this deal that do not make sense. It comes down to the same bottom line: Why should we use American taxpayer dollars for this risky investment? Again, the beneficiary is not an American company but a subsidiary of a British-Government-owned company. The Brits are great allies. We love them. But let them put their taxpayers on the line. Why do we have to put our taxpayers on the line? 
   As Senator Coburn points out, the biggest argument against our amendment is this will create 5,000 American jobs if we agree to this risky loan. Let's ignore for a minute that the Chinese Government says it fully intends to develop for itself the ability to manufacture the parts that Westinghouse would be selling to them--a point made very dramatically by my colleague, Senator Coburn. The fact is, those 5,000 jobs will not last very long when the Chinese learn how to do the work. But, given that, that the 5,000 jobs will be created, we need to put that number in context. We are talking about $5 billion in loans and loan guarantees. It will create 5,000 jobs. 
   U.S. manufacturers have estimated that China's undervaluation of its currency has resulted in the loss of 2 million American jobs. So why don't we do something to change this persistent unfair trade practice and create 2 million jobs--if everything was fair--not 5,000 jobs? If we can't do this through pressure by convincing the Chinese to change their practice or by pursuing a complaint 
   with the WTO, surely there are easier ways to create 5,000 jobs. 
   For example, spending $100 million--2 percent of the size of this deal--on transportation projects would create 5,000 jobs. According to the measurements used by the Small Business Administration, $5 billion in loans and loan guarantees to American small businesses would create 100,000 new jobs. What is wrong with this picture? If we are so ready to give loan guarantees, let's look at giving them right here to our small businesses. Of course we are not going down that path today. It is a point of priorities. 
   Count me out for this. The 5,000 jobs are not real. They will not last long. It is a British-owned company. And we can do much more with $5 billion in loan guarantees to our small businesses and create 100,000 jobs. 
   This Chinese nuclear powerplant deal is a bad deal from an American jobs standpoint. Another thing that makes no sense is that in order to build the nuclear powerplants, we would be selling our advanced nuclear technology to China. I say to my colleagues, wake up. 
   Chinese Major General Zhu Chenghu said:  
   If the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition into the target zone on China's territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons.  
   The date was July 15, 4 days ago, that this major general threatened us with nuclear weapons. 
   The same major general said on the same day to the Asian Wall Street Journal on the Financial Times:  
   Of course the Americans will have to be prepared that hundreds of, or two hundreds of (or) even more cities will be destroyed by the Chinese.  
   I believe this was stated in the context of the Taiwan situation. 
   We are at the brink of giving a $5 billion loan, or loan guarantee, part of which, according to the Ex-Im Bank, will go directly to China to give them the technology they need so that this general can run around and make threats to use nuclear weapons. This is beyond belief. I hope and pray and maybe go so far as to trust this general is not reflective of reality in China. 
   But even if you do not believe this guy has any clout, what a time to give them nuclear technology when one of their top military people is threatening us. What a time to give them the opportunity to steal our technology. 
   China is one of the largest violators of U.S. intellectual property rights in the world. That is indisputable. Coming from California, I know too well the piracy of American movies, music, software, and other products committed by China. It costs American businesses billions of dollars every year. A movie and a record represents millions and billions of loss to my business people and American jobs, but it cannot kill. We are talking about nuclear technology. That can come back and bite us. We have to assume that the Chinese will pirate our nuclear technology if they pirate all our other technologies. They admit they are going to learn how to use it. When all is said, something is wrong with this picture. 
   I conclude this portion of my remarks in this way. I will paint the picture as succinctly as I can. If the Ex-Im Bank's deal goes through, U.S. taxpayer dollars will be put at risk so that the Chinese Government can pay an American subsidiary of a British company to send U.S. nuclear technology to China where a major general has threatened to use nuclear weapons against the United States--all of this in order to undertake an incredibly risky financial investment, building nuclear powerplants. Not only is something wrong with this picture, something is horribly wrong with this picture. 
   Am I permitted to refer to a House vote on the Senate floor?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what I was going to ask the Senator--but it is more a rhetorical question--is, Why does China need this money anyway? We already owe China $230 billion they have loaned us buying our Treasury bills. We pay them now billions of dollars of interest--billions, multibillions. I was going to ask my friend a question, but it was a rhetorical question. The Chinese do not need any more dollars. They have dollars all right. They have so many dollars it is unbelievable: dollars from the trade deficit that is huge and climbing. They have the interest payments that we pay them. 
   Now they need another $5 billion? This is the most outrageous thing I have seen come across my desk. I will tell you this: If we cannot win this amendment, I say to my friend, I do not know who we are here fighting for. It does not make any sense. Set aside our differences on nuclear power, that does not even have to come into it. My friend from Pennsylvania says there is not a risk? Give me a break. Talk to any American businessman who has done business in China. I meet them all the time in California. Oh, everything is promised. Oh, it is all going to be great. Somehow it does not happen, and they are left holding the bag. 
   I wish I could protect my California businesspeople. I cannot. But I sure can protect my California taxpayers. For 5,000 jobs in Pennsylvania--which, by the way, the Chinese Government admits they are going to take the technology. They admit it. I will give them that. And they are going to replace those 5,000 workers. 
   In light of what the general said 4 days ago: The Americans will have to be prepared that hundreds of or two hundreds of or even more cities will be destroyed by the Chinese with nuclear weapons--he says: We'll have to respond with nuclear weapons--that is what he said in light of a conversation about Taiwan. 
   So what is wrong with this picture? We are putting taxpayers on the hook for $5 billion in loans and loan guarantees to a British-Government-owned subsidiary, where it will create, in the short term, 5,000 jobs, what the Chinese say will not be long-lasting, to give them nuclear technology so they can build better weapons against us and have more materials to use against us. It makes no sense. 
   I want to create 100,000 jobs in America. I want to create 2 million jobs in America. Do you know how we can do  that? By cracking down on the way the Chinese deal with their currency. If they would allow their currency to float, we would create more than 2 million jobs in America, and it would not put the taxpayers on the hook for anything. 
   As my colleague from Oklahoma said--as we both have said--if you want to put up $5 billion in loan guarantees, why not do it for American small businesses, and instead of creating 5,000 jobs, create 100,000 jobs. If that is my choice, I come down on the side of the American worker. This is 5,000 jobs, at $1 million a job. This makes no sense whatsoever--and putting the taxpayers on the hook. 
   So no matter how I look at it, the Chinese do not need this money. And do you know what I say? Let the Russians have this deal. Let the French have this deal. Let the French put their taxpayers at risk. Let the Russians put their taxpayers at risk. I am not moving forward toward this deal, which is the largest deal ever done by Ex-Im Bank, to benefit a country that has threatened us with nuclear weapons, at least the major general has. 
   This is insane. If anything should garner a big bipartisan vote, it is the Coburn-Boxer amendment. We do not team up that often. We have a couple times. This is really interesting. And we do it for different reasons. But do you know what? Overall, it is looking out after the taxpayer. That is the bottom line of this particular amendment. 
   There are many issues where I could stand up on this floor and say to my tax-paying constituents: There are certain things that I think are worth investing in. I think it is worth investing in No Child Left Behind and making sure our kids can read and write. Yes, it is going to cost money. Yes, it is a bit of a risk because some of the kids may not learn, and that is a problem. I guess you could argue with that. But I think, overall, the benefits outweigh the risks. 
   What is the benefit here to give over technology that the Chinese say they are going to learn; they are going to replace the American workers; they will have technology they can use against us? I think it is a bad deal. It is bad for the American taxpayer. It is a terrible message to send from a foreign policy point of view. The jobs we are creating are costing $1 million a job. They are very few jobs. They will not last long. 
   I cannot say enough how I hope this amendment will be adopted with an overwhelming vote. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Coburn-Boxer amendment will stop us from putting at risk $5 billion of taxpayer money. My colleague from Pennsylvania can say all he wants that he believes the Chinese will never default, no problem, just come and talk to the business people who have made investments in China. It hasn't been a pretty picture. 
   The fact is, if this is about creating jobs, the Senator from Oklahoma and I and others have shown much better ways to create far more jobs that will really benefit the American people. This is something that we should not do. 
   I am on the Foreign Relations Committee with my colleague in the chair, and we are very proud of that committee. We want to be known as ``Uncle Sam.'' We don't want to be known as ``Uncle Sucker.'' I think we have a chance tonight to say we are Uncle Sam; we are not Uncle Sucker. We are going to protect the taxpayers and American jobs. I hope we will have an overwhelming vote, just as the House voted for a similar amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am going to read part of this letter. He says:  
   Our work to restore structural integrity to our levee system began over a year ago. We cannot wait for a disaster to strike and must use the lessons of Katrina and act now. Prior to Katrina, New Orleans had a 250-year level of flood protection.  
   And then the Governor says:  
   Sacramento has 100-year level of flood protection.  
   That is optimistic. Most experts tell us that it is an 85-year level. And whether it is 85 years or 100 years, it is the lowest of any major city in the U.S. 
   The Governor writes:  
   It is only a matter of time before there is a significant levee breach or system failure.  
   This is important for the Senator from Oklahoma to hear. I know he has been very gracious in filling me in on this and saying: I didn't go after your other items but just this one. But the fact is, this one is as important as all the rest. The Corps has told us they need these funds to move forward. 
   Here is what the Governor says:  
   Such [a flooding] event would flood valuable farmland that produces food for [our] entire nation.  
   I say to my friend from Oklahoma, please, listen to us, because the food supply for the entire Nation is at stake, according to Governor Schwarzenegger, Senator Feinstein, myself, and a bipartisan delegation in the Congress. 
   The Governor says:  
   All of Sacramento and other Sacramento Valley towns would be flooded. According to modeling [that has been done], a single levee breach would cause flooding in many areas of the City with depths over 15 feet. A flood event of this magnitude would cut off Southern California's water supply.  
   I say to my friend from Oklahoma, in this body we are all equal, two Senators from every State. We have 37 million people in my State. Sacramento is a huge growth area. I will get into the  numbers in a minute. We are not talking about a few people being hurt. We are talking about a catastrophe. We are talking about farmland. We are talking about the State's water supply. About two-thirds of the water supply in the State comes from that northern area. 
   When my friend started, he was very nice and said he doesn't doubt the fact that the Sacramento levees are a problem, and that San Francisco has been having problems. I wrote down what he said. He said: San Francisco and the area south of there. This is the area north of San Francisco. This is Sacramento. I don't think my friend really, with all due respect, gets the intricacies of what we are dealing with here. There is a difference between north of San Francisco and south because north of San Francisco is where we have delta--again, two-thirds of the water supply of our State--the farmland and all the rest. South of San Francisco, we have Silicon Valley. That has other issues. But right now, we are talking about the Sacramento area, which is north. 
   The Governor goes on to talk about the economic disruption. Because we are such a large State, people say when California sneezes, the country gets a cold. It is an expression that speaks to the power of our State in terms of economic productivity. And in terms of the goods coming across into the ports of California and going all across into your State and everybody else's--this region is the bread basket. So we ask you to back off this amendment. 
   This is so not a partisan issue. The Governor writes:  
   As you know, Senators Feinstein and Boxer have worked closely with Chairmen Cochran and Domenici to include funds in the pending supplemental ..... for certain levee and flood control improvements ..... 
   I support these funds and want to assure you that this is a necessary and urgent time for Congress to act.  
   The Governor came here. He met with Senator Domenici and many Senators. He said:  
   ..... any investment at this time decreases the chances that Congress will have to respond in the future with another far more expensive emergency funding bill to address a widespread flood disaster in California.  
   I ask that you recognize this as a necessary emergency funding bill. Support this. 
   I want to show a picture. Senator Feinstein showed us a version of this. They all tell a story better than I could. Here you have the Sacramento River. Here you have thousands and thousands of people. Here you have the levees, and here you have the riverbed. And what has happened, if my friend would like to take a look at this--I know he doesn't question that we need a project; he questions whether it belongs in this bill. I understand.

   Mrs. BOXER. That is what I just said. I said the Senator doesn't oppose us doing this. He doesn't want it in this bill. That is my understanding of his position. I couldn't disagree with you more. When my friend quoted me and I said Iraq should have been in the budget, that is exactly how I feel, because we knew about it. Frankly, we didn't know about this, that we were going to have the kind of events we have had, the rain and the rain and the rain. I will go into the details of how much rain we have had compared to other years and the fact that anything can happen now. 
   The weather patterns are changing. When I lived in the bay area in California so many years ago, it is too long to remember, when I first came here in 
   the 1960s, you never had rain in March, let alone April. It was dry. It was dry really from mid-February on. It has been moving forward, and we have March as one of the rainiest months and then April. We had a month this year--April--where we had rain almost every day. It is unheard of. You can see how muddy this is. You can see the breaks here in the riverbank. 
   I will show you another picture on the other side where there is not as much development but the same thing has occurred. These trees were on the other side of the riverbank. Look at these trees. They are now buried in the water. So if we don't go ahead with the Corps now, when the Corps tells us we need to do this now, we are going to lose this riverbank. We are going to lose the levees. And then it is too late. 
   My friend says he wants to save money. It reminds me of the old adage of penny wise and pound foolish. It is a colloquialism, but the fact is, you have to prevent things. This is an emergency circumstance, as the Governor said. These levees could break. Now we have a snowmelt. That snowmelt occurs, that water gets deeper, the pressure in that river increases, and the riverbank begins to disappear, leaving those levees exposed. 
   I wish to refer to a document put together by the Chamber of Commerce in Sacramento. It reads, ``Sacramento: A Region at Risk.'' Cities and counties don't like to say, especially chambers of commerce, we are at risk. They don't like to say that because they want to have investment. They want people to come in. They don't go about saying: We are in danger. And when a chamber of commerce goes out and says: We are in danger--and these are Republicans mostly, and these are as conservative as my friend from Oklahoma; they know that an investment is not wasteful spending if, in fact, we are going to save money at the end of the day. How much would we have saved if we had built stronger, better levees in Louisiana? Untold, probably billions. I don't think my friend is at all a fiscal conservative by taking away $11 million. It is reckless. I hope and pray that my colleagues are listening to this debate and are looking at these pictures and understanding what we are talking about. 
   The Sacramento area faces a triple flood threat, and it faces it now. We have a confluence of two major rivers, the threat of a deteriorating flood control system, and the threat of near record precipitation this year. We are talking about 165,000 homes, nearly 500,000 residents, the State capital, and many businesses providing 200,000 jobs. It is also the hub of the six-county regional economy, providing hundreds of thousands of jobs. A major flood along the lower Sacramento or American Rivers would cripple the region's economy. I will go into that tomorrow because Senator Feinstein and I each have 15 minutes in the morning. I will save some of my talk for then. 
   California has the world's fifth largest economy, and we are quibbling over $11 million that the Corps says it needs to fix up these riverbanks. How outrageous, how shortsighted, how foolish. I don't understand why my friend is doing this. We talked. He feels deeply about it. I respect that. I voted with him a couple of times. I have been very careful, picking and choosing, sticking with the committee when I felt the committee was right, joining my friend. But I don't understand this one. This one is inexplicable. 
   The average family understands that if they have a problem with their roof, they fix it. They don't put it off. They fix it so that their home is not destroyed. It is straightforward. 
   Let's look at the pocket again. They call this the pocket of Sacramento; 112,000 people are at risk, and you can see clearly where this riverbank has deteriorated. On New Year's Day, Californians in the northern and central parts of our State awoke to flooding that cost the State $200 million. We are talking about $11 million so we can mitigate what comes next. But precipitation after January 1 has kept river levels very high, further stressing and eroding our critical flood control infrastructure. 
   Precipitation, including snow pack, as the snows melt, is nearly twice the normal amount, 174 percent of normal, and that is just as of last week. And the snows are just now starting to melt. 
   We have another threat to this area. My colleague, Senator Feinstein, said it beautifully: How would we feel if we did something on this Senate floor today that turned our backs on this issue and then we had a tragedy? 
   We would not feel very good about it. So I am going to save the rest of my talk until tomorrow. But I am going to say to you, Mr. President, again thank you. It is very rare that we have such bipartisan cooperation in our State. This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. We will have Republicans suffer if we have a problem and  we will have Democrats suffer. We are Californians united. Our Governor has recognized the crisis. He declared a state of emergency earlier this year to expedite improvement of this system. 
   Everything we did in this bill we cleared with the Army Corps and they say they can use this money. They need this money. They are going to move forward with these repairs. So my friend from Oklahoma can make the case every which way he wants. He can use rhetoric and say anything he wants. The bottom line is this, and I will quote Representative Dan Lungren, a Republican, who is very well respected among our Republican friends in this body. He said:  
   Today the Sacramento region has half the flood protection and twice the risk as did the city of New Orleans prior to Katrina. The cost of recovering from a flood-related disaster far exceeds the price of guarding against it.  
   Unlike other issues where we have come to the floor and it has been Republican versus Democrat, I can honestly say to you that I stand here representing a bipartisan, strong majority in my State and, hopefully, in the Senate, that says this: The 2005 hurricane season taught us some hard lessons--that we neglect shoring up eroded and damaged flood control infrastructure for major metropolitan areas at our peril. 
   We always say we must learn from history. We must surely learn from recent history. Sometimes we forget history that occurred way back, but we certainly should remember history from a year ago. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote a resounding no on this Coburn amendment and to take a stand for innocent people in this valley, in this area, these farmlands, these farmers, and the economy, and don't take out $11 million that could do so much good to restore these banks. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I cannot allow certain things that were said to go unchallenged. My friend says this is not about paying your share, after he said it was about that. He made a big point, why doesn't California do something? Of course, we are doing something. We abide by the law. I have to say to my friend, if something happens in California, a bread basket of this country in many ways, there is going to be suffering throughout this country. If something happens to this economy, let alone the 112,000 people who live in this pocket, this particular amendment will put them at greater risk. 
   My friend says he believes in prevention. He is a doctor. I am sure he does and I am sure he does a wonderful job at that. But he doesn't believe in prevention right now, I will tell you that. Because that is what Senator Feinstein, Governor Schwarzenegger, and both Democratic candidates for Governor--everybody agrees this has to be done. This is a Federal project. This is not a State project. This is a Federal project with a State share. The Army Corps has a responsibility which they have stepped up to the plate to do, and they told us they need these funds. As far as not paying for this, we know that emergencies get special treatment around here because they are emergencies. My friend says, why is this an emergency? Take a look at this. This isn't the way a river is supposed to look, the way a riverbank is supposed to look. This isn't the way a tree that was on the land is supposed to look, when it was on the other side of the riverbank. When you get the second highest predicted snow pack melt known to the history since they started taking down the record, in the history of California, yes, you have an emergency. 
   I know my friend from Oklahoma left the floor. I hope he joins me in a pay-as-you-go budget because I have voted for that every year. Frankly, right before the Bush administration, we had surpluses. Now we have deficits. I will admit that. I support pay-as-you-go budgeting. I have voted for it. We can talk about that another day. But this is a true emergency, just as I believe funding the veterans home in Mississippi was, which I was sorry I didn't get a chance to vote on. I listened to the debate. I could hardly believe my ears that the Senator from Oklahoma  was objecting to making sure that our veterans, elderly veterans, could go home. What is wrong? Something is wrong here with these debates. I don't know where the heart is, where the soul is. I don't know where the common sense is. 
   I pray and hope that tomorrow, come morning, we are able to get the votes to keep this funding in the supplemental. Again, I thank Senator Cochran. I thank the Chair for his patience. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, just over 5 short months ago, the Bush administration finalized a rule that weakens and delays required controls on emissions of mercury from coal- and oil-fired powerplants. We should overturn this rule today. 
   This vote presents a clear choice: does the United States Senate support protecting the health of millions of children in our nation, or does it support protecting the profits of industries that emit mercury, which poisons our children and environment? 
   The Bush administration supports the interests of polluting industries. The administration's rule saves the electric industry money, but at a severe cost to public health. The administration has--once again--used the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to protect polluters. 
   Mercury is a potent poison. Studies show that it may damage the human cardiovascular, endocrine, immune, and respiratory systems. It also harms the nervous systems of developing fetuses. Low levels of mercury exposure in utero can damage a fetus's brain and create long-term injuries, including learning disabilities, poor academic performance, and reduced capacity to do everyday activities like drawing and learning to speak. 
   Up to 637,000 children are born each year having already been exposed to levels of mercury associated with brain damage. 
   Just last week, on Sept. 8, 2005, the Center for Children's Health and the Environment, located at Mount Sinai Medical Center, found that more than 1,500 babies suffer from metal retardation due to mercury exposure in utero. In addition to the life-long personal impacts, the study found that the nation loses $2 billion annually from such injuries. 
   Forty-five States warn people to reduce or avoid consumption of fish from waterbodies that contain mercury due to the risk associated with eating these fish. Mercury levels become concentrated in some fish, reaching more than one million times the level of mercury in the water. 
   Where does this mercury come from? Powerplants are the single largest source of U.S. emissions of mercury, accounting for 44 percent of all such emissions. These powerplants emit 30 percent of the mercury that currently pollutes U.S. waters. Fish contaminated with mercury is the main source of exposure for people in our nation. 
   The Clean Air Act requires reductions in mercury emissions that are crucial to protect public health. But, the Bush administration has decided to ignore the law. 
   EPA's rule on coal- and oil-fired powerplants implements slower and weaker requirements than under the Clean Air Act. This ill-advised rule delays reductions for 10 years and allows higher emissions of mercury, compared to the Clean Air Act's requirements. EPA's projected reductions in emissions under the rule do not meet the reductions required by the Clean Air Act. And, in fact, this chart shows the reductions do not even meet what the rule itself calls for. 
   Why did the EPA get it so wrong? 
   Well, for starters, EPA used language from utility-industry lawyers--almost word for word--to create the rule. 
   On September 22, 2004, the Washington Posted reported that:  
   For the third time, environmental advocates discovered passages in the Bush administration's proposal for regulating mercury pollution from power plants that mirror almost word for word portions of memos written by a law firm representing coal-fired power plants. ..... The EPA used nearly identical language in its rule, changing just eight words. In a separate section, the agency used the same italics [the law firm] used in their memo ......  
   Let me repeat the last part. The industry memo and the rule that EPA proposed even used the same italics. 
   What else did EPA do wrong? 
   The EPA's own inspector general found that senior EPA officials told career EPA staff to produce a rule that allowed 34 tons of annual mercury emissions, rather than to produce a rule that complied with the law. 
   Let me quote from a 2005 EPA inspector general report that examined EPA's mercury rule:  
   Evidence indicates that EPA senior management instructed EPA staff to develop a Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standard for mercury that would result in national emissions of 34 tons annually, instead of basing the standard on an unbiased determination of what the top performing units were achieving in practice.  
   Again, this bears repeating: Senior EPA officials rigged the rulemaking to allow the power industry to emit a heavy metal that can poison children. 
   But, it doesn't end there. 
   Both EPA's inspector general and Congress's Government Accountability Office found that EPA failed to assess all of the public health benefits of reducing mercury. EPA ignored demands  from its own Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee and other public health groups to asses such injuries. 
   Let me quote from a January 4, 2005 letter that the Advisory Committee wrote to the EPA:  
   While we are pleased to see that EPA is considering additional external analyses, we note that EPA has not conducted the analysis recommended by [the Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee] ..... Specially, we asked the Agency to develop `an integrated analysis with respect to whether emissions reductions under either of these proposals are the most child-protective, timely, and cost-effective,' using existing available data. ..... The [Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee] notes that none of the [EPA's] Principle questions for consideration [of the rule] addresses the importance of healthy child development in assessing a country's economic competitiveness.  
   The Advisory Committee wrote four letters admonishing the EPA to conduct the needed analysis and increase protections for children. 
   Did EPA listen? No. EPA unlawfully allowed industry to emit poison, and then turned a blind eye to the injuries suffered by the children who will be hurt most from this decision. 
   In this rule, EPA chose not to require coal and oil-fired powerplants to make the same types of reductions that medical and municipal waste incinerators have made. These facilities, which emit mercury, have reduced their emissions by 90 percent using the maximum achievable control technologies. 
   EPA got it wrong by cooking the books, using industry-supplied language, willfully ignoring the most severe public health impacts, and simply refusing to make powerful industries comply with the same rules as other entities. 
   We must reject EPA's rule to delist these facilities as emitters of hazardous air pollutants. The Senate must join with the religious community, public health advocates, fishermen and hunters, environmental groups and more than a dozen states in opposing this rule. 
   We must vote to protect public health, not the profits of the power industry.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if it is all right with Senator Dodd, I wish to be heard on the Reid amendment for not longer than 15 minutes.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate has now taken up this important issue. I compliment Senators Lott and Dodd for working together, as well as Senators Collins and Lieberman. We needed to have this debate. We need to have these changes. 
   Over the past several months, we have all heard the sorry tale of scandal and corruption and bribery involving Jack Abramoff, senior Bush administration officials, and, sadly for us, Members of Congress. Those tales have unfolded here in Washington. It is clear that these scandals show corruption has taken hold here and that we in Congress must act. That is why I am so glad we have set aside time for this bill. 
   The measure on the floor today makes important strides in cleaning up corruption, but, in my view, it doesn't go quite far enough. Under the leadership of Senator Harry Reid, Senate Democrats have advanced legislation that goes even further, but it doesn't go so far as to make it unworkable or unreasonable. 
   We were and Senator Reid was the first to respond to the revelations of scandal and corruption in Washington. Nearly the entire Democratic caucus united to create a package of reforms which we call the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2006. It was the first idea that we rolled out for the American people to see. 
   I believe the Reid bill helped set the tone for the bill we are debating today. I do, again, Mr. President, thank Senator Lott for his leadership in the committee. I thank him for working so closely with Senator Dodd. And I say the 
   same to all my colleagues involved in this issue because we know the partisanship here is deep and the Senators set it aside, and for that we are all grateful. 
   What we have before us is an excellent start. If we did that and nothing else, it is a start. But we have a chance now to do better. I think the American people won't settle for just a good start; they want to see deep reform. They want the revolving door slowed so that they don't see Members of Congress--Senators and House Members--staff members, and administration officials walking out the Capitol steps and walking right into a lucrative job where they will have undue influence in terms of what goes on in the Congress. 
   The American people want to feel they still have a voice, even though they don't have thousands or maybe millions of dollars to shell out on K Street where the lobbyists thrive. They want gifts banned. They don't want to see a commission report on why the latest scandal happened; they want measures in place that prevent scandals from taking place at all. 
   My colleagues and I on this side of the aisle are prepared to offer amendments to strengthen this bill, and Senator Reid's package is the first such attempt. I believe it is important, again, to strengthen this bill and raise it to a standard in which our constituents can take comfort. 
   We truly need to go beyond what we have before us. We also need to go beyond the Congress and follow the money, as sordid as it may be, and follow the meetings, and follow the contacts between Mr. Abramoff and the White House. So far, the White House is quick to admonish those outside the administration who engage in scandalous acts. Yet they have maintained a policy of duck and cover and denying when allegations are pointed in their direction. 
   I will have an amendment calling on the White House to cooperate, to turn over the information that we and the public deserve to have on how many times Jack Abramoff was in the White House, or his associates, and what it is they wanted and what it is they got and what it is they gave. That amendment will be coming soon. It is very clear. I hope it will be accepted. I know that my side of the aisle supports it. 
   My amendment simply says that the White House should fully disclose all of its dealings with Mr. Abramoff. We certainly should disclose our dealings, and as far as I know, every Member has gone back and looked to see if they received contributions from Mr. Abramoff, if they received contributions from anyone associated with him. Many of us have acted to either return those contributions or to explain why we would rather give them to charity. We have opened up our books. The White House has to open up its books as well. 
   Again, I am very pleased at the bipartisan effort that has taken place to bring ethics reform to the floor today, and I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada and continue this bipartisanship. 
   Anyone who knows Harry Reid knows he is a reasonable person who loves this institution, who has given his life to public service, starting from the time he was a police officer. The Reid amendment serves only to strengthen the reforms we seek and that the American people demand. This is what it does in part. 
   It closes the revolving door so that the outcome of legislation is not tied to a Member's potential job prospects. It ends the K Street project by shutting down the pay-to-play corruption scheme. K Street offices should be staffed by individuals who are the most qualified for the job, not well-placed former congressional staffers who obtain their job through a back-room deal to stack the deck in any party's political favor. And we know that calls come routinely to these offices saying: Hire this staff or that staff, and the implication is you will be treated better in legislation. It is a disgrace. 
   The Reid amendment increases penalties for violations of the rules under the Lobbying Disclosure Act as a further deterrent for lobbyists to engage in unethical practices, and it prohibits dead-of-night legislating to allow for an open meeting of the conferees with access by the public. The public is so shut out around here. Not only are Democrats shut out of some conferences, but the public certainly knows not what is going on. We want the light of day to shine. If you want to stop those bridges to nowhere and other projects that don't make any sense, open up the process to the light of day, and all of us--all of us--will be scrutinized. 
   I think we should impose tougher restrictions on congressional travel and gifts. We know there is a difference between traveling in an official congressional delegation and traveling because some company wants to do you a favor. We know what that is about. There is a difference between a truly educational trip that is sponsored by a foundation with no ties to special economic interests and a trip that is organized by some economic interests that want to treat you in a way that will make you more open to what they want. There is a difference here, and I think what the Reid amendment does is walk that line. 
   So with this bill, amended by the Reid amendment, the American public will have reason to feel confident that laws are being written and debated and voted on by Members who respect democracy and the wishes of their constituents and are not unduly influenced  by forces that simply want it because it is good for their bottom line. 
   We must be open, we must be honest, and we must be ethical. I know each of us tries to do that, but the rules need to reflect the highest denominator, not the middle, not the lowest. With this bill, we are at the middle denominator. The Reid amendment and some other amendments offered by colleagues on both sides of the aisle can bring us up to that highest level, and I hope we will start by voting ``aye'' on the Reid amendment in a bipartisan way. It will set the tone of this debate. 
   I thank my colleague Senator Dodd for yielding me this time. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President I rise today with my colleague Senator Feinstein to introduce a bill to combat gang violence and honor a young girl from California, Mynesha Crenshaw, who was killed last year in a tragic shooting. 
   On November 13, 2005, a gang-related dispute broke out in San Bernardino, CA and gunfire sprayed an apartment building, killing 11-year old Mynesha Crenshaw and seriously wounding her 14-year old sister as they ate Sunday dinner with their family. 
   Imagine the fear and anguish the family and the community still feel over this tragedy a young girl, full of hope and promise, dead. Her big sister, wounded from the same gunfire, though thankfully she subsequently recovered. Imagine the fear that this could happen again. Our hearts and our prayers go out to Mynesha's family and to the entire community, which like so many others across the United States, has struggled with gang violence. 
   Last year, there were 58 homicides in San Bernardino, a city of 200,000 east of Los Angeles, and 13 more homicides so far this year. And just last month, two men were caught in a gang-related crossfire and died in Downtown San Bernardino. This has to stop. It is a waste of life; it is unacceptable. 
   San Bernardino's diverse population of young people and their families face many challenges, but San Bernardino also has a vibrant and united community, strong leadership, and a desire to come together to improve their city. 
   Mynesha Crenshaw's death galvanized over 1,000 residents to take to the streets, demanding change. And some 40 community and religious leaders, public officials, and concerned citizens from San Bernardino have joined together to form ``Mynesha's Circle'' to find solutions to the plague of gang violence and to help San Bernardino's young people grow up safe, finish school, and succeed in life. 
   I applaud Mayor Patrick Morris, Police Chief Michael Billdt, community leaders Kent Paxton and Rev. Reggie Beamon and Robert Balzer, the publisher of the San Bernardino Sun, for taking up this cause. 
   I want to also thank all the other members of ``Mynesha's Circle'' Sheryl Alexander, Betty Dean Anderson, Donald Baker, Fred Board, Ruddy Bravo, Hardy Brown, Cheryl Brown, Mark and Katrina Cato, Larry Ciecalone, Stephani Congdon, San Bernardino City Schools Superintendent Arturo Delgado, Tim Evans, San Bernardino County Schools Superintendent Herb Fischer, Rialto Schools Superintendent Edna Herring, Sheriff Rod Hoops, Syeda Jafri, Walter Jarman, Rev. David Kalke, CSU President Al Karnig, William Leonard, Sheriff Gary Penrod, DA Michael Ramos, Sandy Robbins, Doug Rowand, Larry Sharp, Ron Stark, Tori Stordahl, Heck Thomas, David Torres, Mark Uffer, San Bernardino Police Chief Gary Underwood, Councilmember Rikke Van Johnson, Bobby Vega, and the Sun Reader Advisory Board members: Daniel Blakely, Barbara Lee Harn Covey, Mark Henry, Julie Hernandez, Lynette Kaplan, Brenda Mackey, James Magnuson, Julian Melendez, Ernest Ott, Jeffrey Pryor, John Ragsdale, Glenda Randolph, Nora Taylor, and David Torres. 
   I have pledged to do what I can at the Federal level to help San Bernardino. And that is why today I am introducing ``Mynesha's Law,'' with my colleague, Senator Feinstein. 
   ``Mynesha's Law'' will create an interagency Task Force at the Federal level, including the Departments of Justice, Education, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development, to take a comprehensive approach to reducing gang violence and targeting resources at the communities in our nation most at risk. The resources will come from proven existing Federal programs, including Child Care Block Grants, Head Start, Even Start, Job Corps, COPS, Byrne Grants and other programs the Task Forces chooses. 
   Communities will be able to apply to the Department of Justices for designation as a ``High-Intensity Gang Activity Area'' and then be eligible to receive targeted assistance from the Task Force. 
   The Task Force will be required to report annually to Congress on the best practices and outcomes among the High-Intensity Gang Activity Areas and on the adequacy of Federal funding to meet the needs of these areas. If the Task Force identifies any programmatic shortfalls in addressing gang prevention, the report will also include a request for new funding or reprogramming of existing funds to meet the shortfalls and the bill authorizes such sums to be appropriated.  
   In addition to ``Mynesha's Law,'' I am seeking a $1 million appropriation that the city of San Bernardino has requested to implement a comprehensive gang intervention and prevention strategy called ``San Bernardino Gang Free Schools.'' The program would fund 10 probation officers to provide gang resistance and education training to 57,000 students, as well as case management and oversight for at-risk youth. 
   I am also requesting a $3 million appropriation to renovate and equip what may be the most important organization for at-risk young people in the area the Boys and Girls Club of San Bernardino. 
   The Boys and Girls Club is one of the few safe and supportive places in San Bernardino where young people can go after school to get help with homework or play sports with their friends. Many community leaders believe the Boys and Girls Club is one of the best gang prevention programs in San Bernardino and has helped many young people stay in school and out of trouble. 
   This tragic shooting of Mynesha Crenshaw symbolizes the struggle that so many communities across the United States, like San Bernardino, face in combating gang violence and serves as a reminder of the nationwide problem we face in protecting our children from senseless violence. I believe ``Mynesha's Law'' will help the children of San Bernardino, and across our nation, grow up safely so they can reach their dreams.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will increase the fuel economy for our Nation's Federal fleet. 
   Americans are facing record high gasoline prices at over $3 per gallon. In some places in my State of California, people are paying over $4 per gallon. Oil is selling for over $75 per barrel. 
   We need to say ``enough is enough.'' We need to reduce our dependence on oil and gasoline. We can do this without changing our quality of life by investing in fuel-efficient cars. 
   The Federal Government must set an example to the American public by improving the Nation's fleet. Each year, the Federal Government purchases 58,000 passenger vehicles. According to the Department of Energy, the average fuel economy of the new vehicles purchased for the fleet in 2005 was an abysmal 21.4 miles per gallon. 
   In an era, where hybrid cars on the market that can achieve over 50 miles per gallon (mpg), that level of fuel economy is unacceptable. 
   Instead, our government needs to purchase fuel-efficient cars, SUVs, and other light trucks. 
   This can be done today. I drive a Toyota Prius that gets over 50 mpg. The Ford Escape SUV can get 36 mpg. 
   To have the Federal Government set an example for the American public and to create a larger market for fuel-efficient vehicles, I am introducing the ``Fuel-Efficient Fleets Act of 2006.'' 
   This legislation would require all new Federal fleet vehicles to obtain a minimum miles per gallon based on vehicle type. The new fuel efficiency standards would be as follows: 45 mpg for cars, 36 mpg for SUVs, 24 mpg for pickup trucks, 20 mpg for minivans, and 15 mpg for vans. 
   The bill establishes a phase-in schedule over 4 years to allow for flexibility in purchasing new cars. 
   Additionally, the bill has a provision to allow the standards to be increased if technological advances allow fuel economy to improve. 
   Finally, the bill authorizes $100 million in incentive grants for the States' fleets to match or exceed the Federal standards. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. This will be a good step to use less gasoline in this country.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you so much. 
   For most of us in the House and in the Senate, we have spent our lives fighting for what we believe in, always fighting to make our Nation better. We may not agree from time to time, but we are always fighting to make our Nation better. We have fought for social justice. We have fought for economic justice. We have fought for environmental justice. We have fought for criminal justice. Now we must add a new fight: the fight for electoral justice. 
   Every citizen of this the greatest country in the world who is registered to vote should be guaranteed that their vote matters, that their vote is counted, and that in the voting booth in their community their vote has as much weight as any Senator, any Congressperson, any President, any Cabinet member, or any CEO of any Fortune 500 corporation. I am sure every one of my colleagues agrees with that statement, that in the voting booth everyone is equal. So now it seems to me that under our great Constitution of the United States of America, which we swear allegiance to uphold, which guarantees the right to vote, we must ask certain questions. 
   First, why did voters in Ohio wait hours in the rain to vote? Why were voters at Kenyan College, for example, made to wait in line until 4 a.m. to vote? It was because there were only 2 machines for 1,300 voters when they needed 13. 
   Why did voters in poor and predominantly African- American communities have disproportionately long waits? 
   Why in Franklin County did election officials use only 2,798 machines when they needed 5,000? Why did they hold back 68 machines in warehouses, 68 machines that were in working order? Why were 42 of those machines in predominantly African-American communities? 
   Why in the Columbus area alone did an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 voters leave polling places out of frustration without having voted? How many more never bothered to vote after they heard this because they had to take care of their families or they had a job or they were sick or their legs ached after waiting for hours? 
   Why is it when 638 people voted at a precinct in Franklin County, a voting machine awarded 4,258 extra votes to George Bush? Thankfully, they fixed it. Only 638 people had shown up, but George Bush got more than 4,000 votes. How could that happen? 
   Why did Franklin County officials reduce the number of electronic voting machines to downtown precincts while adding them in the suburbs? This also led to long lines. 
   In Cleveland, why were there thousands of provisional ballots disqualified when everyone knew that poll workers had given faulty instructions to the voters? 
   Because of this and voting irregularities in so many other places, I am joining today with Congresswoman STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, a 10-year judge, an 8-year prosecutor, a 6-year Member of Congress, a woman inducted into the Women's Hall of Fame. Folks, she has great credibility, and she asked just one Senator to take a couple of  hours. I hate inconveniencing my friends, but I believe it is worth a couple of hours to shine some light on these issues. 
   We passed the Help America Vote Act, which was important to help American voters, but then we did nothing. 
   Senators GRAHAM, CLINTON, and I introduced a bill to ensure that a paper trail go along with electronic voting. We couldn't even get a hearing in the last Congress. In the House, it is the same problem. We need this kind of bill. 
   Let me simply say to my colleagues: I have great respect for all of you. But I think it is key, whether it is Republicans or Democrats, that we understand that the centerpiece of this country is democracy, and the centerpiece of democracy is ensuring the right to vote. 
   I ask you, my friends from both sides of the aisle, when we get busy working within the next few weeks, let us not turn away from the things that happened in Ohio. Our people are dying all over the world. A lot of them are from my State. For what reason? To bring democracy to the far corners of the globe. Let us fix it here, and let us do it the first thing out. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I want to begin today by again thanking Chairman Lugar and Senator Biden, our ranking member, for a very fair debate on the nomination of Dr. Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State. I know these votes usually go overwhelmingly for the nominee. The last time there was any vote against a nominee, I think the most votes were Kissinger at 7 votes. So I know that what I am doing is not about winning a vote; it is simply about telling the truth as I see it and other Members telling it as they see it. 
   At the end of the day, when Senators vote, some will be very enthusiastic about the nominee and feel very good about their vote. Others will be a little anxious. I sense with Senator Biden, he certainly has anxieties over it, but he is very hopeful. And knowing JOE BIDEN as I do, that definitely fits his character because I think he gave Condoleezza Rice opportunity after opportunity after opportunity to set the record straight, to level with the committee. Senator Biden was not on the floor yesterday, but I kind of replayed his give and take with future Secretary Rice on the issue of how many troops were trained, and he was literally begging her to please be candid. It is interesting because after that give and take, which was picked up by the news media, Ambassador Negroponte came into it and said: Clearly, there are not 120,000, but there are more than 4,000. 
   All this dancing around is not academic because, as Senator Biden clearly stated and as we all know, our exit strategy in Iraq is based upon the ability of the Iraqis to defend themselves certainly. We all are working toward that day, but we can't do it if we are not going to be honest about how it is going, and we can't help the administration if they don't level with us as to how things are going. 
   I found it interesting--and this has nothing to do with this particular nomination--that the White House Chief of Staff called those of us who wanted to debate this ``petty.'' I saw one clip of him saying that the two Senators--he didn't mention the names--who were trying to get this nomination to the Senate floor and have some time to talk about it were ``small.'' I don't think he was talking about my height. That is showing such a disrespect to the American people, as we go around the world trying to bring democracy. It is something we all want to do. We may have different ways of going about it, but we want to do it. How do we stand tall if we don't uphold our Constitution? Our Founders believed it was crucial for the Senate to play a strong role in the selection of these very important and powerful positions. 
   Well, thanks to Senators LUGAR and BIDEN, we have done that. I am glad.  
   The reason I am going to be voting no is clear to anyone who has followed this debate. I asked Condoleezza Rice a series of questions in five different areas. I gave her every opportunity to correct the record. I asked her about her statements that the aluminum tubes Saddam was buying could only be used for nuclear weapons, and she talked about the mushroom cloud and frightened the American people at a time when we know she had the information that there was a very strong dispute going on in the intelligence community and that, in fact, she had known in 2001 about this issue. She refused to budge. 
   I asked her about her continual statements that al-Qaida 
   and Saddam were close. It was not true. At the time she made those comments, the State Department itself put out a very important map--this was 1 month after 9/11--saying that in fact there was no al-Qaida whatsoever in Iraq. They were nowhere in Iraq. She refused to budge. 
   I ask unanimous consent that I may have an additional 4 minutes.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
   I asked Dr. Rice about my concerns in five areas. I don't fault the President for picking someone who believes in this war, who helped him in her position. That is not the issue. The issue has to do with the lack of candor that continues to come from Dr. Rice. 
   As recently as a few months ago she wrote a letter which resulted in a very important amendment in the Intelligence bill being stripped from that bill. This was a bill by Senators MCCAIN and LIEBERMAN, and this provision was written in part by Senator Durbin. It was an antitorture provision. She opposed it. She wrote that she opposed it. When I asked her about it, she denied that she opposed it, when she had opposed it in writing. 
   I know there are other Senators coming to the floor of the Senate and saying this argument doesn't hold because she made statements that came from faulty intelligence. If that were the case, I would have no problem with Dr. Rice. Everybody knows there was faulty intelligence. But she continues to put out these misstatements. As a matter of fact, in front of the committee, if one listened closely, she muddied the waters even more. So I gave her the chance to clear it up, and she didn't. That is bad for the Senate. It is bad for the American people. 
   Dr. King said--and I often repeat it--our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. This debate mattered. Responsibility matters. Accountability matters. It matters when you give someone a chance to correct the record that is replete with half-truths and misstatements, and they don't take that opportunity. 
   Dr. Rice is a role model. She is smart. She is intelligent. She is qualified. She is loyal to this President. I don't question any of that. All of that makes everyone proud. The fact is, it would have been very condescending and inappropriate to have someone as skilled as Dr. Rice before a committee, someone as involved in setting the course of this war as Dr. Rice before the Foreign Relations Committee, and not ask her the kind of questions we all did. 
   I don't know whether we will have two votes against this nominee or four or seven or eight. I really don't know because I haven't asked one colleague how they are going to vote. This has not been the point of what I have done. I have simply tried to say that holding people accountable is important, that this war matters, that we need to look at the mistakes of the past so we don't repeat them, so we don't send our young people into another war based on hyped-up rhetoric and half-truths. 
   I thank my colleagues all and again say to my chairman how much I appreciate him. I look forward to moving past this on to the other work of our committee and the other work of the Senate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today to provide for the Purple Heart to be awarded to all prisoners of war who die in captivity, regardless of the cause of death. The ``Honor Our Fallen Prisoners of War Act'' was previously introduced by Representative BOB FILNER in the House of Representatives. I am proud to join him in this effort. 
   The ``Honor Our Fallen Prisoners of War Act'' would make members of the Armed Forces who die in captivity of any circumstance eligible for the Purple Heart. Currently, only prisoners of war who die during their imprisonment of wounds inflicted by an instrument of war are eligible for posthumous Purple Heart recognition. Those who die of starvation, disease, abuse, or other causes during captivity are not. 
   I believe this is an injustice to the thousands of POWs who paid the ultimate price in service to our Nation. The purpose of the Purple Heart is to honor those who are killed or wounded in action as the result of an act of an enemy of the United States. It makes no sense that prisoner of war camps--where thousands of Americans have been held against their will and have endured great suffering at the hands of enemy forces--are not considered a battlefield. 
   The legislation is retro-active to December 7, 1941 and would therefore include all POWs who have died in captivity since World War II. 
   The ``Honor Our Fallen Prisoners of War Act'' has been endorsed by the Tiger Survivors, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Korean War Veterans Association, National League of POW/MIA Families, and a number of other prominent veterans organizations. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, each year Congress appropriates millions of dollars to institutions of higher learning that serve minority students. Currently, funds go to historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribally controlled colleges and universities, and Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions. These funds--which exceeded $890 million in fiscal year 2005--  help institutions provide more higher education opportunities for low-income minority students. 
   For schools that serve a large number of low-income Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, however, Federal assistance is not available. A need is not being served. 
   Over 42 percent of Cambodian Americans, almost 35 percent of Laotian Americans and 25 percent of Vietnamese Americans live in poverty. And the graduation rates among these populations are low. Only 13.8 percent of Vietnamese Americans, 5.8 percent of Laotian Americans, 6.1 percent of Cambodian Americans, and 5.1 percent of Hmong have college degrees. 
   So, today, I am introducing the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Higher Education Enhancement Act. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Akaka. 
   This legislation creates a new Federal grant program for institutions where Asian and Pacific Islander students make up at least 10 percent of the undergraduate student body. Priority will be given based on the number of low-income students. 
   The grants--authorized at $30 million in the first year, and such sums as necessary for the next 4 years--could be used for a variety of purposes, including outreach to secondary and elementary school students, curriculum development, tutoring, counseling, and student support services. 
   Mr. President, we need to make college accessible for low-income Asian American students as we do for with other minority students. This bill is an important step toward this goal.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Murray in cosponsoring this important amendment  to increase veterans health care funding. We owe it to our veterans, who have so bravely served our country, to give them the best medical care possible. It is disappointing that funding for veterans programs, especially veterans health care, has not kept pace with either the increased number of veterans in the system or medical inflation. This amendment is crucial to providing veterans with the services they have earned. 
   As I have talked to veterans in California--and as I have met with returning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan--I have come to one disturbing conclusion: we are not serving all of the needs of our veterans now and we are not prepared to serve the tens of thousands of veterans who will be returning over the next couple of years. 
   Senator Murray's amendment begins to address this situation. It will increase veterans health care funding by almost $2 billion. This includes $610 million for new veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Funding for these veterans is not included in the current VA budget. In addition, each of the 21 veterans regions will receive $40 million to address their budget shortfalls. This will allow each region to determine how the funds can best be used to benefit their veteran population. 
   I am especially pleased that this amendment includes funding designated for veterans mental health care. Specifically, $525 million is designated to expand mental health services, with $150 million targeted for the treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder--PTSD. The VA has estimated that 30 percent of men and women currently serving in the Armed Forces will need treatment for mental illness or readjustment issues. That is why this funding is so critical. 
   This amendment has the support of many veterans organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, and Paralyzed Veterans of America. They realize, as I do, how crucial it is that this funding be made available. Without it, the VA will not be able to meet the needs of the men and women who have so bravely served our country. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will use a very short amount of time, knowing colleagues are anxious to get moving on this bill. 
   I feel heavy in my heart because this Senate is such a wonderful institution when we authorize afterschool programs in the United States of America. We did that, and we have had a very sad response in terms of the funding that does not match the authorization. 
   I think my colleagues know full well the FBI says there is no program that does more to keep our kids out of trouble than afterschool programs. That is why Senator Ensign and I teamed up originally to get the first of afterschool programs authorized by this Congress. But it has been very sad. 
   I know the Senator from Pennsylvania supports this program. I know the Senator from Iowa, who heads this important subcommittee, supports these programs. Most Senators support these programs. But right now is a moment when we have to stand up for our kids. 
   Look at what has happened. Despite the fact we are supposed to be going toward $2.25 billion, we are actually now funding afterschool at less than $1 billion--less than we were in 2002 because the afterschool programs have not been exempted from across-the-board cuts. 
   What we will do today with this amendment is add back--this is very important--$51.9 million, which will get it back to the $1 billion area. At least we will take it back to where it was in 2002. 
   This is a very sad day. 
   I want to say something to my friend from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the subcommittee and someone whom I admire greatly, Senator Specter. What we have here is a real sadness for our children. We have a situation where we are actually cutting the funding of afterschool programs year after year after year while our children cry out for attention after school. The FBI tells us this is the best. 
   The Bush administration's Drug Enforcement Agency takes taxpayer money and places ads all over America's televisions that say, It is 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Do you know where your children are? It is 3 o'clock, 5 o'clock. Make sure you know where your children are. They spend taxpayer dollars with one hand warning our families to take care of their kids after school and with the other hand we and they are complicit in cutting the afterschool programs. 
   We are covering 1.3 million children. There is another couple million to 3 million who need afterschool care. The least we can do is add roughly $51 million to protect this program from inflationary costs and at least get it back to where it was in 2002. 
   For the sake of our children, for the sake of our families--I am talking here about our poor families, our working poor families, our middle-class families, and our upper middle-class families, and, yes, frankly, even our wealthier families who also support these programs, I urge you to please vote aye on this amendment. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mrs. BOXER. I know the Senator is a big supporter of the afterschool program because I remember when the President was looking to cut it in half. He and I were looking at this together, and we spoke. I think it was teaming up with Members on both sides of the aisle to help. I want to point out to my dear friend that when Senator Ensign and I got together and wrote the authorization part which you have been so wonderful to fund, we were very clear in our authorization--and everyone supported it--that, my God, to actually reduce the funding of this program is a big mistake. 
   I say to my friend, getting this program to $1 billion occurred because we all worked together on the authorization, and we were fortunate to have appropriators who agreed with us. 
   But in 2002, even with the best efforts of my friend, we haven't even protected this program from inflation from 2002 to today and to 2006. We actually have a cut in real dollars to the program below inflation. It is tragic that we will lose children from this program which the FBI says is so important. 
   I want to make one more plea to my friend. I am not asking for $1 billion, which in fact we should have if we follow the authorization. All I am asking for is enough funding--such a small sum that it is an asterisk in this budget--to please add $51.9 million. That is all. We will at least bring it back up to $1 billion, because we haven't been protected from across-the-board cuts. 
   I make a plea to my friend. I know everything around here is precedent setting, to do this or that or the other. These are real kids. There is real stuff going on out there, and they need these afterschool programs. 
   I yield the floor and thank my friend very much for yielding to me.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Commercial Airline Missile Defense Act. This legislation is designed to ensure that our commercial aircraft are protected against the threat posed by shoulder-fired missiles. 
   I first introduced this legislation in February 2003 in response to two separate attacks attributed to al Qaeda terrorists. The first attack was the attempted shoot down of a U.S. military aircraft in Saudi Arabia. The second attack was against an Israeli passenger jet in Kenya. Fortunately, there were no casualties in either case. 
   But make no mistake, the threat posed by these weapons--also known as man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS)--is very real. In May 2002, the FBI said, ``..... Given al Qaeda's demonstrated objective to target the U.S. airline industry, its access to U.S. and Russian-made MANPAD systems, and recent apparent targeting of U.S.-led military forces in Saudi Arabia, law enforcement agencies in the United States should remain alert to the potential use of MANPADS against U. S. aircraft.'' 
   In February 2004, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Admiral Lowell Jacoby, testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on current and projected national security threats. He stated the following: ``A MANPAD attack against civilian aircraft would produce large number of casualties, international publicity and a significant economic impact on aviation. These systems are highly portable, easy to conceal, inexpensive, available in the global weapons market and instruction manuals are on the internet. Commercial aircraft are not equipped with countermeasures and commercial pilots are not trained in evasive measures. An attack could occur with little or no warning. Terrorists may attempt to capitalize on these vulnerabilities.'' 
   It is estimated that there are between 300,000 and one million shoulder-fired missiles in the world today--thousands are thought to be in the hands of terrorist and other non-state entities. 
   Since I first introduced my legislation in 2003, progress has been made in adapting countermeasures now being used by the military for use on commercial aircraft. A special program office has been created within the Department of Homeland Security that is working to demonstrate and test two prototype countermeasure systems. Flight testing is scheduled to begin in a matter of weeks. 
   This legislation, which I am again introducing with my primary cosponsor, Senator SCHUMER, states that the installation of countermeasure systems on commercial aircraft will begin no later than 6 months after the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the countermeasure system has successfully completed a program of operational test and evaluation. 
   We need to continue to move forward to ensure that commercial aircraft are protected from the threat posed by shoulder-fired missiles. I appreciate the hard work of my colleague in the House, Congressman STEVE ISRAEL, who is a real leader on this issue. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this important legislation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my amendment would require that employers take real steps to attract and hire U.S. workers prior to petitioning the Department of Homeland Security for authorization to hire an H-2C nonimmigrant. In other words, what we are trying to say here is, if there is a job available for an American worker, for a U.S. worker, let's make sure that they get that job before we give it away to an immigrant worker. 
   Over the next 5 years, a million foreign workers could enter the country under that guest worker program that is in the bill. This is a million new workers who will be competing with U.S. workers for jobs. Advocates of the guest worker program claim that it is needed because Americans are not willing to do the jobs that will be filled by these foreign guest workers. But it seems to me, whether you believe that or not, we need to ensure that every step is taken to hire a U.S. worker first, because these jobs we are talking about are not agricultural jobs. Those are addressed in a different section, the AgJOBS bill. We are not talking about high-tech jobs because we take care of that in another portion of the bill. So let's take a look at the jobs we are talking about. I have them here on this chart. 
   These are the jobs that will be taken by guest workers unless we can say that, in fact, there is an American worker for their job. I ask rhetorically, will we have U.S. workers for construction jobs? Will we have U.S. workers for food preparation jobs? Will we have U.S. workers for manufacturing jobs? Will we have U.S. workers for transportation jobs? Clearly, if you look at the jobs that are being held today, 86 percent of construction jobs are held by U.S. workers; food preparation, 88 percent; manufacturing, 91 percent; transportation, 93 percent. So obviously, there are workers in this country, U.S. workers who can take those jobs, rather than importing a guest worker to take them. These are good jobs. They pay well. Right now, again, the overwhelming number of them are held by U.S. citizens and legal workers. 
   Why is it that U.S. workers want these jobs? It is because they pay well. The average worker in the construction sector gets $18.21 an hour or $37,890 a year. Construction work is a good job. It is a job for which there are many U.S. workers. If we are going to open these jobs to foreign workers through the guest worker program, we  better make sure that employers cannot find a U.S. worker who is willing to do the job. U.S. workers deserve to get the first crack at these jobs. All we are saying to the employers is, do anything you can first to make sure you can fill this job with an American worker. 
   The underlying bill is vague on what employers have to do. That is the reason why we are working with the working people here. We have come up with a very good way to ensure that there are concrete steps that have to be taken by employers before they fill a job with a foreign worker. Again, the underlying bill says the employer has to say: I made a good faith effort. But it does not lay out specific steps that they have to take. So the bill doesn't do enough to ensure that U.S. workers will find out that there are openings, and it doesn't do enough to make sure that they have an opportunity to apply for a job before it is given away to a foreign guest worker. 
   This amendment throws light on the process. It makes sure the job listings get to the U.S. workers in time to make a difference. I say to colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you stand with U.S. workers, then vote ``yes'' on this amendment. 
   What is it that we ask employers to do? It is quite simple. We ask them to submit a copy of the job offer to their local State employment services agency before they file a petition for an H-2C worker. Then the State employment agency is authorized to post the job on the Internet, job banks, and with unemployment agencies. In addition, the agency, if they wanted, could share the job listing with local unions representing workers that are relevant to the job listing. 
   What else does the employer have to do? I already said they had to notify the State employment agency. They have one more thing they have to do. They have to post in a conspicuous place in the workplace a notice that says there is a job opening. That is all they have to do, put up a notice that there is a job opening. Put it in a conspicuous place, tell the State employment agency there is a job opening, and allow them to recruit. We do not add any more time in the process. It all is done in the same timeframe. 
   This amendment is a win/win for everyone. It is a win for the employers because they are going to give a good chance to a U.S. worker. It is a win for America's workers. The burdens that we place on employers are practically nonexistent: To notify the State employment department and to post a notice of the job opening. 
   There is no delay. The bill already requires employers to make a good faith effort, and they have to do that 90 days before they file a petition. All of this will be done in that timeframe. 
   Our amendment helps U.S. workers find out about job openings before employers file a petition for a foreign worker. Unemployment agencies and unions get a chance to find out about the jobs. They can present those to qualified workers. In fact, both the AFL-CIO and the Teamsters strongly support this amendment. 
   We think as a result of this amendment, the news of a job is spread broadly. And hopefully a U.S. worker will fill the position. If not, the employer is free to file his petition and recruit a foreign guest worker. I believe if we do not impose adequate recruitment procedures, it is the U.S. worker who will ultimately pay the price and, frankly, revolt against this bill. Jobs that should have been filled domestically will be given to foreign workers, and that is wrong. Unemployment will increase, and there will be downward pressure on wages and working conditions. This amendment would help ensure that companies will be able to get the workers they need and that U.S. workers will have a chance to fill those positions. 
   I retain the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is not what we do. Before a guest worker is hired, we ask the employer to do two things during the 90-day period, the same period. We ask him, like the bill says, to make a good faith effort. And part of that we define as posting the job in the workplace and calling the local State employment department. And then if they can't find an American worker, then they can hire a guest worker. We don't say it is after the guest worker is hired. I felt compelled to tell my friend. Please, if you could reread the amendment, because what we say is during that 90-day period that you have, we are only adding a requirement of simply posting that position and notifying the department of employment.

It says the employer must make a good faith effort before hiring a guest worker, and he or she has to take 90 days. All we do is say, in that 90-day period, the employer must post a job notice in the plant and notify the department of employment. That is all we are doing. We don't change anything in the bill. We just say during the 90-day period, post the job and let the State Department of Employment know. I don't understand why we have a problem with this.

   Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise now to discuss an amendment on behalf of myself and Senators Kerry and Lautenberg, which expresses the sense of the Senate that the White House should provide the public with a thorough account of the meetings that the President, his staff, and senior executive branch officials held with Jack Abramoff. The public's confidence in the Government has been rocked, rocked by the widespread reports of public corruption involving Jack Abramoff. 
   On January 3, Mr. Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy, fraud, tax evasion charges, charges that carry up to a 30-year sentence. He agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in their investigation of a number of public officials, and we don't know where all this will lead. I urge the Justice Department to continue its investigation into any bribery and corruption. 
   The damage to the public trust from the Abramoff scandal, combined with the recent prosecution of Congressman Randy Cunningham, and the indictment of Congressman Tom Delay is massive. The investigation by the Department of Justice has really just begun. But right now, sadly, there is a very low opinion of politicians, and trust must be restored with the American people. We cannot govern effectively without the support and confidence of the people. We are supposed to be their representatives. We owe them everything, and we must start with honesty, with ethics, so we can regain their trust. 
   If the people have lost confidence, we have to win it back. Every Senator I know has searched his or her records for contributions from Jack Abramoff, from his associates and the tribes he represented. Each of us has responded in our own way. But to my knowledge, we have all made our actions public. We have told our constituents what the situation is and whether we plan to do something about it. 
   In the State of the Union Address the President 
   said:  
   Each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility--and that is a pledge we must never forget, never dismiss, and never betray.  
   Those are noble sentiments, very noble sentiments, and I challenge the President to live up to them. Where there is an appearance of impropriety, it is the responsibility of public officials to be open with the public and to clear up any questions that might exist. I know in my long career in elected life, and it is now more than 30 years of elected life, I have had to return contributions from time to time. I have tried to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. I have even recused myself on three occasions because I believed that was the right thing to do. But no matter what each of us does there will still be those who doubt us. It is the system. It is a system that is based on private financing, so it is very difficult, with that system, to gain the trust of the people. 
   But it starts with openness. It starts with transparency. We should each try to be as open as we can and make sure that, whatever we decide to do, the public is informed. It doesn't help to be secretive. It doesn't help to say: I don't have to do this; it is my right not to tell the public anything. It may be your right, but it does not make it right. 
   According to the press secretary of the President, Scott McClellan, the President does not know and doesn't remember ever meeting Jack Abramoff, and despite repeated requests the White House has failed to provide details of meetings between Jack Abramoff and the President and his staff. The problem is, more and more details keep coming out about the relationship between Mr. Abramoff and the President. 
   Starting in 1997, Mr. Abramoff claimed credit for procuring a letter  from then-Governor Bush that praised the then-Northern Marianas Island Education Plan. In 2000, Jack Abramoff joined the Bush-Cheney transition team. Several colleagues of Mr. Abramoff ended up being appointed to key positions in the Department of Interior, the agency that regulates Indian gaming issues, central to Mr. Abramoff's lobbying business. 
   According to the Associated Press, Jack Abramoff and his lobbying team had nearly 200 contacts with the Bush administration in the first 10 months they were in office--200 contacts in less than a year, and nobody remembers anything? I mean it doesn't pass the smell test, to be crude about it. 
   By 2001, Mr. Abramoff appears to have been selling his clients access to the President. On May 9, 2001, the White House arranged an event on behalf of the group Americans for Tax Reform. That group is a very strong ally of President Bush. The event was attended by the President and a number of legislators. There is a trail of documents that shows that Mr. Abramoff asked some of his clients for $25,000 to go to that event, with the funds going to this Americans for Tax Reform. 
   I want to show you some e-mails because I think that tells the story better than anything. So here is what Mr. Abramoff asked in an e-mail to a representative of one of his tribal clients. These are Mr. Abramoff's words from an e-mail.  
   Americans for Tax Reform is bringing together the speakers of all Republican-led legislatures for a meeting with Bush and the congressional leadership. They have requested sponsorship ($25 K) from only four groups. Two of them will be major corporations and one will be Choctaw. Chief Martin will be coming to the event I expect. I told them that I would ask you guys to participate. The exposure would be incredible and would be very helpful. One of the things we need to do is get the leaders of the tribe (ideally the chief) in front of the President as much as possible. Please let me know as soon as you can. Thanks.  
   That is Mr. Abramoff to the representative of one of the tribes. 
   Let us see what that particular individual wrote to her tribe after she received Mr. Abramoff's e-mail. She wrote:  
   Attached is an e-mail from Jack Abramoff with the firm of Greenberg & Traurig. The chairman has agreed for the tribe to be one of the four sponsors of and participate in a White House event on behalf of the Americans for Tax Reform which is being held on May, 9, 2001 in D.C. Please immediately prepare a check made payable to Americans for Tax Reform in the amount of $25,000 and forward it to my office by Federal Express. Then Fed/Ex the check to Mr. Abramoff.  
   Just to finish this story, here we have a copy of the check Mr. Abramoff received from the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana in the amount of $25,000--selling the President of the United States and using Federal property. 
   The meeting was held in the Old Executive Office Building. In all, it appears that four or more of Abramoff's clients attended the event, and at least two claimed they paid the $25,000 requested. They paid that to get close to the President on Federal property. Jack Abramoff, as I said, delivered the President of the United States in exchange for his clients' contribution to the President's supporters. How many more Abramoff clients attended is not clear, and who paid money to attend the White House event is not clear. The White House claims it has no record of Mr. Abramoff attending, but Time magazine claims there is a photo of the President standing with Abramoff and one of Abramoff's clients. 
   This event alone warrants the President providing full disclosure of meetings with White House officials and Jack Abramoff. 
   But this was not a one-time event. The following year, Mr. Abramoff solicited money from his clients for another White House event in behalf of Americans for Tax Reform. 
   The public has more and more questions about the relationship between Jack Abramoff, the President, and his staff, but no answers are forthcoming. The President's refusal to provide additional information about these meetings has increased the public's distrust in the administration and our Government at large. 
   The President said some very noble words at the State of the Union Address. He said it was important for us to bring trust back. Yet we see no movement for transparency and openness. 
   The public has a right to know whom Mr. Abramoff met with, what they discussed, and whether improprieties existed. According to a Washington Post/ABC News poll, 76 percent said Bush should disclose his contacts with his aides and Mr. Abramoff. Two of three Republicans favored disclosure. Let me say that again. In the poll, two of three Republicans favored disclosure. 
   In fact, members of the President's own party in the Senate and in the House have urged the President to provide information to the public about this administration's dealings with Mr. Abramoff. I agree with them. All Government officials who serve the public must take all steps necessary to maintain their trust and confidence. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this important amendment which I plan to offer on behalf of Senator Kerry and Senator Lautenberg. It simply calls on the White House to immediately and publicly disclose each visit and meeting between Jack Abramoff and the President, White House staff, or senior executive branch officials. 
   Much is made about how Senators get an opportunity to fight for funds for their State. Senator McCain has derided this action. Senator McCain said earmarks right on their face are wrong. If you look at the number of earmarks Members of the Senate are involved in for our States--I know my colleague and I sit on the Public Works Committee. I don't need any lobbyist to tell me that I need a road in my urban area when one is broken down. I don't need a lobbyist to tell me that I need an HOV lane or a new water system or a new sewer system or a new school or a new senior center. It is my job to know that. Senator McCain thinks that is all terrible. But the bottom line is the number of earmarks pales in comparison with the amount of funds that are distributed by this administration and any subsequent or prior administration. They distribute most of the funds. 
   It is very important, as we all look at our campaign contributions, to sort out in any of them which are in any way tainted by Mr. Abramoff and that the White House comes to the table and is as open as we have been. I believe it is very important. This isn't a partisan issue. Republicans have been calling for the White House to come clean on this, and Democrats are doing the same. 
   If we are going to restore confidence in our Government, it starts with simple openness, not saying: Oh, this is privileged, this is secret. I will tell you right now, we all learned it from our moms and dads. When somebody says, this is secret, watch out. Our Government is supposed to be open, not secret. 
   I hope there will be strong support for this particular amendment. I believe its timing is crucial. We can't let any more time elapse. 
   There are calls for--and I am joining them--a special prosecutor in this particular case. But even before that debate begins, let us have everyone come clean on these meetings, contributions, and the like. 
   I thank my colleague from Montana, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, for his generosity of spirit in allowing me to discuss this issue. Technically, of course, it isn't a matter of the Finance Committee jurisdiction, but I believe the timing is so important that we should have a vote on this. 
   Thank you very much. I yield back whatever time remains.

   Mrs. BOXER. Excellent. Mr. President, I am going to speak about the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown. Before I go into the reason I hope the Senate will reject this nomination--and the ``reasons'' because there are many--I wish to put into context for my colleagues, and for anyone watching this debate, why the Senate has spent so much time looking at the rules surrounding the nomination and confirmation of Federal judges. 
   It is very clear when you vote to confirm a Federal judge that it is a very important vote. Why is that? It is because these judges really vote on so many issues of importance to us, whether it is our right to vote, our right to a safe workplace, our right to privacy, our consumer rights--it goes on and on--our victims' rights. The fact is, these issues are crucial, and who winds up on the bench on Federal courts is very important to the American people. 
   This is not an abstract debate about Senate rules and procedures; it is really about who sits on the courts, and why is it that for 200-plus years the minority party has had the right to filibuster or delay the vote on nominees who they believe are outside the mainstream--whether that means they are to the far right of the mainstream, as in this particular case, or to the far left of the mainstream. 
   Presidents who have tried to pack the courts in the past, have tried to twist the arms of the court, have been rebuffed, from Thomas Jefferson, once, to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, another time, when FDR had 74 Democrats in this Chamber. He could do anything he wanted, if they agreed. He had won his election by 60 percent of the votes. He decided he did not like what the courts were doing, so he said: Well, I want to double the size of the courts. He had the votes. But the Democrats in the Senate said: Mr. President, we like you. We love you. We think you are a great President. But we will not allow you to pack the courts because the bottom line is that our Founders did not want a ruler, they wanted someone to govern. They did not want a ruler, they wanted someone to govern. Therefore, they believed very strongly in checks and balances and the rights of the minority so that we do not have a court system that has on it people who would be so far out of the mainstream as to disrupt the very fabric of our country. 
   Now, this President did his own move to pack the courts. Let's face it, that is  what happened. He had the agreement and acquiescence of almost a majority of the Senate, until a few brave Republicans came over to our side and said: Look, let's step back from this precipice. Let's not do away with the filibuster. These are lifetime appointments. These judges get good pay, and they are never up for election. This is the only check and balance we have, when their names are brought before us. 
   So I was so appreciative of my colleagues on the other side for standing up and saying: We are not going to change the rules of the game in the middle of the game because some President wants to pack the courts with people who are so far out of the mainstream that it could set our country back for generations. That is what really happened. 
   Now, in order to get that deal they came up with, they said to our side: You are going to have to give. You are going to have to give on three judges whom you have stopped. This 10 on the chart represents the number of judges Democrats have stopped. They said: In order to get this deal, you have to give up on three. One of those three judges is Janice Rogers Brown, a nominee way out of the mainstream, to the extreme, which I will explain. 
   But we have to remember this deal only involves the vote to end the filibuster. We said: OK, enough of our colleagues will join with you to end the filibuster. But the deal did not say: Therefore, she would get automatically voted in. We still have the up-or-down vote on Janice Rogers Brown. A lot of us believe very strongly that 51 of us should oppose this nomination. I think we might well get those 51 noes, or close to it, but, obviously, we are pushing for 51. 
   Now, again, I want to focus your attention on these numbers: 208 to 10. It is actually 209 to 10 with the Priscilla Owen judgeship approved. We have stopped 10. We have approved 209. And this President and the Republicans here have been crying every morning that they do not get 100 percent of what they want. They have gotten 95 percent of what they want. It is not good enough. When you want all the power, it is not good enough. 
   When I go home and look in the eyes of my constituency, I ask: If you got 95 percent in your course, would you be happy? Oh, yes. If you got 95 percent of what you wanted from your spouse, would you be happy? Oh, ecstatic. If you wrote a list down of everything you wanted in your life--where you wanted to go for a vacation, where you wanted to be educated, the kind of car you wanted--and at the end of the day you got 95 percent of what you wanted, you would be thrilled, except if you believe you deserve 100 percent, by God, and nothing less will do. That is what we are facing with this Republican power grab. That is what we are facing. 
   Remember those numbers: 209 to 10. When you are out somewhere and somebody says: Well, aren't the Democrats blocking all these judges? No, no, no. Ten; and we approved 209. 
   Now, I am going to show you in just a moment the list of the groups that oppose Janice Rogers Brown to be put on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Now, when you see these groups, you will be shocked because I think everybody knows by now that Janice Rogers Brown is the daughter of a sharecropper. We have heard that over and over again, and that is remarkable. We have a lot of remarkable stories in America. 
   My own mother never even went to high school. I 
   am in the Senate. She had to drop out to support her family. There are lots of stories like that. But I do not expect people to automatically support me because in my family I went to the Senate and my mother never graduated from high school. It is interesting and it is important, and it certainly says a lot about our country and the opportunity our country affords people such as Janice Rogers Brown and BARBARA BOXER, and particularly people of color, women of color who have even a harder time. 
   It is a miraculous country we live in. That is why I oppose her nomination, because she would set it back. It is not her life that I attack when I say I am not for Janice Rogers Brown; it is what she will do to your life. If you look at her record, you will see why the things she will do to your life are things you would not want. 
   So I want you to listen to the groups that are opposed to Janice Rogers Brown:

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today we are passing a significant bill for the people of this country. It will create hundreds of thousands of jobs. It will reduce congestion on our highways. It will move goods more efficiently. And it will improve local transit systems. 
   I was pleased to have been a part of putting this bill together as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and as a conferee on this legislation. 
   This is a good bill for the State of California. In total, California will receive $21.6 billion in highway and transit funding over the next 5 years. That is an average of $1.175 billion more per year for California than the last highway bill in 1998. And it will create an estimated 800,000 jobs in my State. 
   When I arrived in the Senate in 1993, California was getting about 83 cents on the dollar in highway funds. I am pleased to report that with this bill California's rate of return will reach 92 percent. Not what it should be--but a significant improvement. 
   This bill also includes over $1 billion in special projects for California, including over $130 million for the I-405 HOV lanes in the Los Angeles area and $58 million for the Golden Gate bridge seismic retrofit--an extremely important project in helping to preserve one of American's most notable landmarks. 
   Let me tell you why increased funding is so crucial for California. 
   According to the Texas Transportation Institute, Los Angeles and the San Francisco-Oakland region are ranked No. 1 and 2 for the worst roadway congestion in this country. California has two more cities in the top five, with San Jose ranked fourth and  San Diego ranked fifth. The inland empire of San Bernardino and Riverside Counties is ranked 12th and Sacramento is ranked 13th. 
   What does this congestion translate to? Delays--in the Los Angeles area, 136 hours per year, on average per driver, in peak hours. Drivers in the San Francisco and Oakland area experience 92 hours of delays, and San Jose drivers endure 74 hours of delays. Inland empire drivers are delayed 64 hours, and San Diego drivers are delayed 51 hours a year. This is time people could spend with their families, reading a book, or any number of other things; instead, they are stuck in traffic. 
   Congestion will not get better over time. California's population is expected to increase from 35 million people today to 50 million people by 2020. We need to make significant improvements in our transportation system. This bill will help fund the roads that will help ease congestion. 
   And it will also fund transit systems that will enable more people to get off the roads and onto buses, trains, and subways. 
   Transit ridership is up growing rapidly in California. The number of miles traveled annually by transit passengers grew by 20 percent between 1997 and 2001. The number of annual passenger trips was up 14 percent. In the San Francisco Bay Bridge corridor, 38 percent of all trips are on transit. And 30 percent of all trips into central Los Angeles are on transit. 
   This is why I am pleased that California will receive $4.6 billion in guaranteed transit funding over the next 5 years. 
   To mention a few specific examples of projects in California, this bill funds the Metro Gold Line eastside extension in Los Angeles, the Mission Valley east extension in San Diego, the Muni Third Street light rail in San Francisco, and the South Corridor light rail extension in Sacramento. 
   Another issue that I spent a lot of time working on involves grade crossings. Over 40 percent of all the Nation's imported goods come through California ports. The majority enter through the ports of LA and Long Beach. Many of the goods are then put on trams, leave Los Angeles, and travel through Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. This causes terrible local congestion. 
   To help that problem, this bill funds over $150 million for the Alameda corridor east for grade separations. 
   In addition to congestion, grade crossings create significant safety problems. This bill includes my provision for a study of grade crossing safety. The study would direct the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with State and local government officials, to conduct a study of the impact of grade crossings both on accidents and on the ability of emergency responders to perform public safety and security duties. This would include the ability of police, fire, ambulances, and other emergency vehicles to cross the railroad tracks during emergencies. 
   Finally, this legislation recognizes that we can both improve our transportation system and improve our environment at the same time. 
   For example, I worked to ensure that fuel-efficient hybrid cars can be allowed on HOV lanes. This will provide incentives for people to purchase fuel-efficient vehicles, and will allow the State of California to implement a law passed last year. 
   In addition, this bill promotes bike and pedestrian paths. Funding is provided for the Virginia Corridor Rails to Trails plan, which will convert a Union Pacific railroad right of way into a bicycle and pedestrian trail in Modesto. Also, Marin County will receive $25 million to develop a network of bike and pedestrian paths. 
   This bill has been several years in the making. It has been the subject of intense--and sometimes tough--negotiations. But in the end, I am glad I had the opportunity to help craft a bill that will do so much to improve the lives of Californians, create so many jobs in California, and make such significant improvements to our transportation system. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Reid-Levin Rockefeller-Biden amendment is very clear. I will read it again so that, hopefully, the American people know what we are debating. This is what we are debating:  
   No Federal employee who discloses, or has disclosed, classified information, including the identity of a covert agent of the Central Intelligence Agency, to a person not authorized to receive such information shall be permitted to hold a security clearance for access to such information.  
   Why is this important? It is important because when this story broke, CIA agents and folks at the CIA were absolutely horrified that the name of a covert agent had been leaked, putting that covert agent in grave danger. 
   Now who could vote against this? I don't know. We are going to find out. But let me state what I think it is about. Either you stand on the side of these brave undercover operatives who risk their lives every day, without people with a political agenda going after them to reveal them, or you stand on the side of those who would play politics and have played politics with their identity. 
   Why did it happen in this particular case? Because this particular administration did not like what they heard from a particular gentleman, and to punish him, they went after his wife. And they didn't care. You cannot tell me because you didn't use her everyday name that it was hard to find out who she was. 
   If somebody says Senator Boxer's husband did thus and so, even if he had a different last name, it would not be too hard to find out who my husband is. 
   So here we had a political agenda and Senator Coleman talks about how horrible it is to play politics on the floor of the Senate. Publishing an ``enemy's list'' is the worst form, and the lowest form, of politics you can have. This took it to a whole other level when it involved someone who was an undercover agent. 
   I want to say a word about the second-degree amendment, which is unbelievable. Under the second-degree amendment, if this passes, every single Member in the Senate will lose their security clearance. Anyone in this Senate who ever came down to the floor and said anything about the pictures at Abu Ghraib will lose their clearance. Anyone who ever came to the floor and said, I think it is important, when the President makes a nomination, we get all the information, including reading an FBI report. Let me say, and I guess I will lose my clearance, but I will say it right now, up against this amendment, this ridiculous second-degree amendment--I say right now, whenever the President nominates someone for a high position and there is an FBI file, I say to my friends, you are not doing your job if you do not read it. 
   Under this, I guess I lose my security clearance. 
   So be it. But I think everyone in this Senate has lost their security clearance because every one of us has spoken about the Iraqi war. 
   Now my colleague says we don't have a security clearance. You have read this. You have written this. So there you go. 
   Your side wrote, can't have a security clearance. So all I can say is, one side can say you are playing politics, the other side can. Put that aside. Read this amendment. It is the right thing to do. Either you stand on the side of the brave men and women who risk their lives undercover every day or you stand on the side of politics. You make up your mind. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, since 9/11, those of us on the Environment and Public Works Committee, in a very bipartisan way, have attempted to bring legislation to the Senate to begin the process whereby we can protect our nuclear power plants, first by making sure that there is an assessment made on each power plant, what are their vulnerability needs, and then making sure that these plants are protected from terrorists. 
   We know that on September 10, 2002, in a taped interview on Al-Jazeera, it included a statement that al-Qaida initially wanted to include a powerplant in its attacks on the United States. And we on the committee passed out a bill and passed another one last month. This amendment says it is the sense of the Senate it should pass bipartisan legislation to address nuclear powerplant security prior to the August recess. 
   Colleagues, we have a limited time. We need to move forward. 
    I would accept a voice vote, if that is OK with Senator Gregg, and I think he would prefer that. But we would like to have a clear voice vote if we could at this time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you. And I thank my colleagues who are working so hard on this emergency supplemental bill which has so many important issues that address the needs of our troops: the need to get the equipment they need, the protection they need, and the needs of the people in the area that was struck by Hurricane Katrina. 
   But I have to say this war, as we know today--and the President said 3 years ago ``Mission Accomplished''--this is not exactly an emergency that he didn't know about, and the war should be paid for in the budget and not in an emergency supplemental. The war is known. The costs of the war were anticipated by some people whom this administration fired, and the costs of this war are spinning out of control. 
   In my own State, about 23 percent of the debt is from people who are from California or based in California, and we are suffering mightily with these debts. The mental health problems of those veterans coming home are not being addressed in the appropriate way. We read about suicides which are off the chart, and divorces are off the chart. 
   I have to say I am very disappointed and concerned and angry that Secretary Rumsfeld still hasn't appointed people to a mental health task force that this Senate voted on and said we ought to have, that the House accepted, and that the President signed into law. On April 7th, that mental health task force was supposed to be in place, and we still do not have the people assigned to it, while our veterans are coming back in very bad shape. I don't understand it. I call on Secretary Rumsfeld to do his job and follow the law and appoint the people to this commission. 
   Frankly, we are not doing right by our veterans. 
   The Senator from Washington is here. I know how much she cares about this issue. I know how hard she fought to expose the fact that the veterans health care budget was underfunded. And with her hard work and reaching across the aisle, we were able to add funding to the veterans health care system. But the needs of our soldiers are still not being met. The horror they face is having a big impact on them when they return home. 
   I will be offering an amendment that addresses this mental health commission, assuming that the Secretary of 
   Defense has not acted. I will also be talking about a very important facility that we need to set up in San Diego to deal with the west coast injured--from Washington, from Oregon, and from California. We do not have a place to treat these who are being injured. A lot of these families on the west coast have to travel to Texas, or have to travel to the east coast, and the Navy wants to see this facility built. I will be speaking about that. 
   Unfortunately, we could not come to an agreement on the immigration legislation that I thought was well thought out. The McCain-Kennedy bill that took a look at the whole immigration issue said: Yes, we must strengthen the border. We have to stop illegal immigration at the border, but we also must deal with the hard-working people who have been here and bring them out of the shadows, not put them in front of the line; put them in back of the line, put them on a path to legality. That bill was not forthcoming from this body. 
   Then Senator Martinez and Senator Hagel offered another compromise which I thought was not as good as the original one because I think it will be a bureaucratic nightmare to administer, but at least it is a compromise between those who want to strengthen the border and those who want to give people a path to legality. Yet we had a vote on that, and Republicans voted right down the line, no. They wanted to have endless numbers of amendments. 
   I have to say it is up to the Republican leader to bring this issue back before us and to resolve it. It is key to my State. It is key to the country. I hope we can work together and once and for all resolve it. 
   Lastly, I want to talk about gas prices. Many Americans are paying well over $3 per gallon for gasoline. Certainly, in my State, I have seen gasoline over $4 in my State. I have heard predictions that that is coming. 
   On a television show yesterday, our Department of Energy Secretary, Mr. Bodman, had bad news for Americans. He said: Well, I guess we are in a crisis. I am not embarrassed about it. But you know there is a problem. We have lost control of supply. I am not embarrassed. Gas prices are high. 
   I don't understand what kind of leadership we have here in this country with this administration. When you talk about Iraq, the President says: Gear up. We are going to have more deaths. He doesn't give us an exit strategy, and he doesn't tell us when this long nightmare is coming to an end. Oh, just brace yourself, more casualties. 
   Then you have the Secretary of Energy, and he doesn't say: Here is my plan. We are going to look at these oil companies. We want to understand why they are making record profits when they say they are suffering with higher costs, that they were simply passing the costs on to us. Yes, prices are going up at the pump, but their profits would be level. Their profits are off the chart. One of their retiring CEOs had a $400 million package when he left. 
   I do not know how the oil companies can say with a straight face that all they are doing is passing on costs when they give one individual $400 million. 
   Think about the average small business in America. They would never dream of seeing $400 million. This is for one individual. 
   I was pleased. I was on one of the Sunday shows with Senator Trent Lott, and we were really looking at this out of the same lens. He was just as upset. And when we talked about windfall profits taxes, he said he is willing to look at it. 
   I hope there is a way we can address the gas prices in this bill. I have been working to try to make amendments germane to the subject, and if we can't get them on this bill, we are not going to go away. 
   We hear that Katrina, the Middle East, Iran, and Iraq are the reason for these prices. And there is no question that instability in the world and the aftermath of Katrina is hurting us. But, again, if these external factors are all it is, we would be willing to pay for that. But, obviously, they are adding a hunk of money into their profits. That is very clear. We are seeing profits off the chart. 
   In the first quarter of this year, Chevron had profits of $4 billion, up 49 percent compared to the same quarter last year. When we look at Exxon profits of $8.4 billion, and a $400 million retirement package for their former CEO, Lee Raymond, it is clear they could afford it. Enough is enough. 
   The President announced that he is halting deposits to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is the reserve that we have in case of an emergency. It is very full. We have been telling the President for more than a year now to please stop taking gasoline off the market and putting it into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. You are shorting the supply. He finally said he is going to stop filling it. However, he has not said he will release any from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This is the time to do it because that would have a downward pressure on gas prices. 
   We also need to take steps to reduce our demand for gasoline. Obviously, when a family buys a car, it is a huge purchase. I know families who are now considering buying a fuel-efficient automobile. My family did, even though it has been in the papers because some reporter didn't do his homework that I own a gas-guzzler; I do not. 
   My family owns three cars and they are all hybrids. I have been driving mine for almost 4 years. It is terrific. The men I know always ask: Does it have pickup? It has pickup, yes. It does very well. The newer version--I have the original version--the newer version now gets over 50 miles to the gallon.  
   I ask myself: Why doesn't the Federal Government buy these automobiles? My good staff who is here today checked it out and found out that every year the Federal Government purchases 58,000 passenger vehicles. According to the Department of Energy, the average fuel economy of the new vehicles purchased for the fleet in 2005 was 21.4 miles per gallon. So we can do better, that is for sure, with just the Federal fleet. It may not sound like a lot, but 58,000 cars that we say we are now going to make more fuel efficient will have a salutary impact on this marketplace. It is going to provide a bigger market for the fuel-efficient cars. I hope, in addition to this, we can have a program where we incentivize States, counties, and local governments to do the same. 
   I got the idea for this bill when I visited the San Francisco autoyard. We looked around and almost every car they have in there is either fuel efficient now or they are working to make it so. They have cars that run on alternative fuels. They are rehabbing their cars. All the good ideas started in our neighborhoods. That was an idea I took. 
   I mentioned before, my hybrid cars are getting over 50 miles to the gallon. We know, unfortunately, that the American car companies are not yet up to where they should be with their fuel efficiency. This is sad. I have sat down with them over the decades--because I lived through the 1970s when we had a fuel crisis--and they still refuse, saying Americans want big cars, too bad. 
   The fact is, at least our American companies are now building fuel-efficient SUVs. This is good. So when the Federal Government has to buy a hybrid car, they can buy a fuel-efficient hybrid car made in America that is an SUV. I hope we can lead by example. 
   I don't take what Mr. Bodman says as a fact, that there is nothing we can do, shrug our shoulders, and walk away. There is something we can do. We can be smart consumers regarding the Federal Government with the taxpayers' dollars. Taxpayer dollars should not be wasted on gasoline that goes straight into the pockets of the oil companies that, in my opinion, are manipulating supply. I will get to that in a minute. 
   We now have a tax credit for buying a hybrid vehicle; the dollar amount varies by vehicle. That is terrific. I propose we have an additional $1,000 tax credit for purchasing a vehicle that obtains a minimum of 45 miles per gallon. There are now cars that get 45 miles per gallon and there may soon be other cars that get 45 miles per gallon, so purchasers of those cars would have the $1,000 tax credit. If you have a hybrid that gets over 45 miles per gallon, if you bought a new one, you would get a $1,000 tax break plus the tax break for purchasing a hybrid. That is very important because it is true the hybrids are a little more costly than a similar nonhybrid car. 
   The President of the United States came forward and said: I am ordering an Federal Trade Commission investigation. I was very glad he did that. Unfortunately, for the eight times I have called for those investigations, I have never had his support. I have called for no less than eight investigations into gas price manipulation, but I was happy he called for--finally, better late than never--an investigation into manipulation among the oil companies and in each oil company. Unfortunately, 4 days later, he said: I have to say I haven't seen any evidence of any manipulation. That was Friday. 
   I am confused. He calls for an FTC investigation and then said: I don't see any evidence of it, but they are working on it. It seems to me that sends a bad signal to the FTC. Why not ask your Justice Department, your Energy Department to work with the FTC and scour every record you can to see if there is zone pricing, to see if they are cutting back on supply? 
   I lived through the Enron debacle. We all did. But when I say I lived through it, those on the west coast got it in the neck from Enron. What did the Enron traders do? They said: We are going to withhold supply. They took power offline, and they said to the public: All we are doing is regular maintenance of our powerplants. That was not true. They were closing down some of the power in order to manipulate supply. 
   Now we look at what is happening in the refinery business, and we see they are not building any new refineries because they are monopolies. They do not want to increase the supply. They like it the way it is. 
   How do I know this? It is pretty clear. California has changed its rules. We have a streamlined procedure now put into place by the Governor and the legislature. Please come in, please build refineries, please do them in an environmentally sound way. Nothing. 
   How do I know what is happening? This is it. Shell Oil announced that they were closing down a refinery in Bakersfield about a year ago or more. We were very upset, Senator Feinstein and I, the congressional delegation, across party lines, the Governor, everyone asking: Why are you closing down a refinery that produces 2 percent of California's gasoline? 
   The answer came back in a letter to me: Senator, we are not making any money in this refinery. We are losing money. Senator, no one wants to buy it. We have put it up there for sale, and we are closing it down, period. 
   We did not believe it. We had learned the lesson of Enron, which is to reduce supply, so we dug around, and we went to the FTC, this Bush administration FTC. Do you know what they did for 
   us, despite all their talk? Nothing. They did nothing. Zero. 
   So we went to the attorney general of the State of California, Bill Lockyer. He said: Let me see what is going on. Guess what he found out. The refinery that they said was making no money was making record profits. Yes, there were many people who were interested in purchasing it. Guess what. It has been sold, and it is still operational. 
   So when I asked the oil company executives from Shell about this at the Commerce Committee hearing, they did not tell the truth. They said: We are so delighted we sold this. They never told the truth.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if this Senate is going to operate and function, it has to follow its own rules. It is very obvious that including drilling in a wildlife refuge in a military bill is not following our own rules. It is no wonder the people in the country are cynical. It is wrong to do this. 
   Members should stand on line, do it the right way. If Members want a bill passed, do it the right way. This is not a Senate where one person can dictate how things get done. 
   I hope the Senate would understand when you are discussing a wildlife refuge, which was first set aside by President Eisenhower, that we would do better than putting it into a military bill  that is a must-pass piece of legislation. I am very pleased that Senator Stevens said if he does not get his way on this, and the Senate decides not to include it here, that we will be able to strip that provision and get those funds where they need to go, to our troops. 
   I am very pleased about that. I hope the Senate will speak strongly in a bipartisan way and vote ``no'' on cloture. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, currently, 10 to 12 million workers are in this country illegally living in the shadows. Of those, approximately 2 4 percent or 2.5 to 3 million undocumented immigrants are living in California. 
   Many of these people are lon gtime residents, hard workers, and with  American-born children. They are the parents of children in your school. They are members of your community who m you know and respect. 
   Any comprehensive immigration reform bill must address the plight of undocumented workers currently in the country. Unfortunately, the current provision in the bill is not rational and could leave millions of individuals without relief and forced to hide. 
   Under the three-tier process created by the Hagel-Martinez compromise, undocumented immigrants here less than 2 years are subject to deportation, and those here from 2 to 5 years must return to their country and seek reentry under a guest/worker program. 
   It is estimated that these tiers would apply to nearly 5 million people--that means approximately a million residents of California would either face voluntary departure or deportation. 
   Families would be broken apart and industries disrupted as workers are forced to leave or go into hiding. California cannot afford and most of its residents do not support the convoluted Hagel-Martinez approach. 
   That is why I was pleased that my colleague, Senator Feinstein, has proposed a much more practical and humane approach in her orange card program. 
   Under the program, all undocumented immigrants who are in the United Stat s as of January 1, 2006, would be eligible to get on a path to leg ality. They would be required to pass criminal and national security background checks, demonstrate an understanding of English and U.S. history a nd Government, have paid their back taxes and pay a $2,000 fine. 
   Moreover, orange card holders would have a continuing obligation to work, pay their taxes, and not to engage in criminal activity. 
   The Feins tein orange card program establishes a realistic approach to dealing with the 10 to 12 million undocumented workers currently in the country. In conjunction with her AgJOBS amendment, Senator Feinstein has addressed two of the most important aspects of th e comprehensive immigration reform bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for the Feinstein amendment. It is a workable solution to a difficult problem.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was pleased to yield time to Senator Stabenow who had a very pressing matter regarding some of her constituents who are stuck in Lebanon with no way out, and a very vulnerable time for many of the families in her district and in her State. 
   Let me start out by saying thank you to my chairman, Senator Inhofe, and to our ranking member, Senator Jeffords, and, of course, Senators BOND and BAUCUS, and the array of Senators who have worked so hard on this very bipartisan bill. We have all worked together, and I believe it is an excellent bill. I thank the staffs for their commitment to this product, particularly Let Mon Lee with Senator Bond, Angie Giancarlo and Stephen Aaron with Senator Inhofe, and Catharine Ransom and Jo-Ellen Darcy with Senator Jeffords. They put in very long hours, many of them, to help all of us, and for that I thank them. 
   All together, this bill represents the collective work of nearly 6 long years. That is how long it has taken to get this water resources bill to the Senate. I think we all agree that 6 years is far too long to wait for a bill that authorizes essential flood control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration projects, projects that help protect thousands of homes and the lives of millions from catastrophic flooding; projects that help restore the great wetlands and the rivers of our Nation. What we learned during Katrina is what happens when we lose the wetlands in our country, and we have been losing them. As a result of that, we lose the natural flood protection that we so desperately need. So restoring the great wetlands we have lost in California--I think it is about 90 percent of our wetlands, and nationwide I think it is even more than that. So we really have lost a great deal of our wetlands, and this bill helps to correct that. It protects the rivers of our Nation, also very important and is addressed here. 
   We have projects that help increase our port capacity and projects that make shipping easier and safer. Specifically, for my State of California, there are many great and valuable provisions in this bill, essential flood control provisions that more than double the amount of current funds authorized to improve and upgrade levees in the San Joaquin River Delta, levees that  will help protect two-thirds of California's water supply. 
   I remind my colleagues--I know you are aware of this--we have almost 37 million people in my State. So when we talk about flood control protecting the population, we are talking about quite a sizable population. 
   We have included ecosystem restoration pilot projects to help improve and restore the Salton Sea, which has been steadily shrinking into the deserts of southern California. The Salton Sea is a remarkable--remarkable--body of water. 
   The bill also includes authorization to restore vast salt marshes and wetlands around the Napa River. 
   I want to highlight one final provision in this bill for California. Earlier this year, I introduced the Los Angeles River Revitalization Act. When I tell my colleagues that there was a river in Los Angeles--there still is--they look at me and say: Well, where is this river? 
   Well, you can take it from me, there is a river. It has been destroyed over time. The local people, with a wonderful project, are trying to restore this river and continue to protect the residents of the area from flooding, but also to provide recreational opportunities for the communities on the riverbanks. 
   The 2006 WRDA bill before us contains key provisions from that bill, including a feasibility study and provisions authorizing demonstration projects to help get this great restoration effort going. If you have time to come with me to Los Angeles, I say to my colleagues, I will show you the amazing possibilities we have for recreation and for the young people in an area that is in great need, desperate need of recreation, because it is so populated and so crowded. 
   So in short, Mr. President, this is a great and important bill for my State. We cannot ignore our water infrastructure. We learned that from Hurricane Katrina. We cannot allow long periods of time to elapse without reauthorizing such a vital and important bill. Most of our colleagues agree, earlier this year, more than 80 Senators signed a letter requesting full Senate consideration of this bill. I have worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, particularly Senators INHOFE and JEFFORDS, in trying to address every colleague's concerns so that we could get to this moment, and here we are. 
   I look forward to discussing and debating several key policy issues relating to this bill. We have a couple of controversial ones, and I will be on the Senate floor as these issues come before us.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on Sacramento flood control at the Folsom Dam, and I want to speak on behalf of my amendment. My statement will be brief because I am very pleased that my amendment has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. Again, I thank Senators INHOFE and JEFFORDS and their staffs. We will be voice-voting this amendment, and it means a great deal to Senator Feinstein and to me and the people from California, be they Republicans or Democrats or Independents. I again extend my thanks to Letmon Lee with Senator Bond, Angie Giancarlo and Stephen Aaron, Catherine Ransom and Jo-Ellen Darcy. I am saying their names again because I think all too often staff just don't get the credit they deserve for the long hours they put in. Their work on this amendment, like so many others in this bill, has been invaluable. 
   I thank Senator Feinstein for being a cosponsor of this amendment. I offer my appreciation for her help in this effort. Very briefly, I want to talk about why this amendment is so important, and then we will have a voice vote and we can move on to Senator Specter's amendment. 
   Sacramento is one of America's largest metropolitan areas that has less than 100-year flood protection, less than 100-year flood control protection. The Sacramento-American Rivers floodplain contains 165,000 homes--I want my colleagues to think about that--nearly 500,000 residents, the State Capitol is there, and many businesses providing 200,000 jobs. It is also the hub of the six-county regional economy, providing hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
   A major flood would cripple the Sacramento region's economy, significantly impair the operations of our government in Sacramento, and cause up to $15 billion in direct damage and up to $30 billion in total economic losses, and it would likely result in significant loss of life. 
   As the capital of the world's sixth largest economy--the world's sixth largest economy--no one can deny it is important to protect the Sacramento region and, fortunately, no one today is denying that. Yet Sacramento is terribly vulnerable to catastrophic flooding, so vulnerable that parts of the Sacramento area were under serious flood threat earlier this year. 
   I remember well, when Senator Feinstein and I came to the floor and we showed you the pictures. We are not going to go through those again tonight because I think you remember those pictures. There was that whole area where you have homes below sea level at risk every single day. 
   To protect this region from flooding, Folsom Dam was completed in 1956. It is located 15 miles northeast of Sacramento on the American River. To improve the dam's flood control capabilities, Congress authorized two projects to increase the dam's capacity and waterflow control. Over the past year, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation have been working to refine and improve these plans. 
   My amendment ensures that this important process continues expeditiously and without interruption. This is what it does. It sets a strict timeframe of June 2007 for the Corps and  the Bureau to complete their report, so that design work can proceed without delay. 
   We all know bureaucracy. They will figure out one way to delay and another way to delay, and before long we have real serious questions of the costs for the project and having to pay more for the project. We pray during that time there will not be a catastrophic flood. 
   We are so pleased that this amendment has been signed off on, on both sides. It also calls for quarterly reports on the progress of the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps. 
   The bill as agreed to by the managers of the bill today is an important next step to provide the region of Sacramento the level of flood protection it deserves. The Corps, the Bureau, and their non-Federal partners are continuing to work on designing the best solution for Folsom Dam, and the outlook is very promising. 
   As S. 728 moves to conference with the other body, I intend to work with my colleagues in any way needed to support this project. Again, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for agreeing with this important amendment, and I hope the day will soon come when we will have that report ready for you and move forward. 
   I ask unanimous consent that all of my time and the time of Senator Stabenow be charged against my amendment. I think that will clear up the time confusion with the Chair. Is that correct? Mr. Chairman, is that making you happy?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Bush administration has announced a plan that includes the use of National Guard forces to temporarily support Federal border patrol operations. While I support additional efforts to secure our borders, it is disappointing that nearly 5 years after the attacks of September 11, 2001, there are still insufficient U.S. Border Patrol personnel to adequately maintain the southern land border. 
   I appreciate the efforts by the Senator from Nevada to clarify the role of the National Guard in implementing the President's plan to secure the border. It is my understanding that the National Guard is being utilized under title 32 of the United States Code, which means that command and control rains with the Governor and the State or territorial government even though the Guard forces are being employed in the service of the United States for a Federal purpose. I also understand that under title 32, the Federal Government will reimburse States for costs, including the logistical costs, incurred during the mission. Finally, I understand that the National Guard will not directly participate in any law enforcement function, including search, seizure, arrest or similar activity. 
   Does the Senator from Massachusetts share my understanding that the Ensign amendment is consistent with the President's plan?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in the next 5 minutes I want to describe this amendment. I cannot imagine anyone in the Senate voting against this amendment. Having said that, I predict that this amendment will not be agreed to because there seems to be some type of agreement going on that this bill can not change at all, in any way, shape, or form. But I want to give the Senate a chance. 
   When I was growing up, my mother said, If you ever borrow anything, give it back. Try not to borrow money, but if you borrow money, give it back as fast as you can. 
   I think all of us here understand that to be a responsible person, you have to be responsible for your debts. There is no question about that. It is not right to borrow money and then turn your back on the person who extended that credit to you, whether it is an individual or a credit card company or a bank. But in this bill there seems to be absolutely no bounds. It seems to be that the person who lent you the money has no responsibility whatsoever to be diligent about it, to be fair about it, to be reasonable about it, or, frankly, to be smart about it. And the credit card companies know they have the perfect bill coming toward them. There is absolutely no responsibility placed on them. 
   I ask anyone listening to this debate to think about how many credit card applications you receive in the mail in a week's time, in a month's time. Once I started saving it up. Then they started sending them to my grandson. He is 9. I was surprised they didn't send it to our cat. I suppose they would, if cats could pay interest. 
   But let me tell you about this particular egregious situation I am trying to fix. I think it would shock Americans to understand this. The fastest growing part of the credit card business is the young people in this country. The credit card companies entice  our young people to go into debt, go into debt, and they know the sky is the limit as to what they can charge for that debt. Is it 10 percent? No. That would be low. Is it 20 percent? That would be low. There was an amendment here to cap it at 36 percent, and that failed. We are talking about taking a young person who doesn't have a clue and offering them credit cards. 
   If I were to ask you how many cards does the average young person have--people between 18 and 24--I would say one or two--the answer is six credit cards. This is the fastest growing group. 
   That is also why the credit card companies go ahead and give more and more credit cards to people who were defaulting the most. Frankly, it is because they are still making a mint. Credit card profits have gone up in the last 10 years 100 percent. 
   When you analyze the stories--I have read them in the Wall Street Journal--you find they are getting paid back for sure, but they are not getting the full 30-percent interest. But the poor people who are caught in this have a real problem. 
   Here is what the amendment says. If a credit card company issues a seventh credit card to someone below the age of 21 without a responsible party cosigning, and if that individual has a job that pays less than the poverty level, then in fact if there is a default the judge should take into consideration the facts. It is as simple as that. 
   Why wouldn't a credit card company ask you that simple question, How many cards do you have? And, What is your income? After all, this is unsecured debt. It is not secured by anything but the person. 
   We are saying, if, in fact, an individual defaults, they are younger than 21, they had no cosigner, they earn below the poverty line, they already have six cards, if they wind up in bankruptcy court, the judge should consider this situation. 
   This is about responsibility on the part, yes, of the person who is using the card, but also on the part of the credit card companies. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Here are the facts, my colleagues. The fastest growing segment of bankruptcies occurs in Americans who are 25 years and younger. The average number of credit cards a college senior has is not two, three, or four, but six. The average senior in college has six credit cards and credit card companies are marketing to our young people at rock concerts, on college campuses. We want responsibility but on all sides. 
   My amendment puts a modicum of responsibility on the credit card companies. It simply says a bankruptcy judge should consider an appropriate response if a credit card company has given a card to a person who is under the age of 21, has no responsible cosigner, an income below the poverty level, and the person already had six credit cards. 
   My friends, I hope you will not march down and vote ``no'' against this amendment. How can you explain at home that a credit card company would have no responsibility if they have given a seventh credit card to a person below the age of 21 who has income below the poverty level? I hope you will support the Boxer amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. I am very pleased with that. I am very pleased he is here. I am also very pleased there appears to be good support for this amendment. We are going to have a record vote because we both believe it is very important to send a loud and clear message about the subject of this amendment. 
   This amendment ensures that no funds in this bill will be used to enter into an agreement with the Government of Iraq that would subject U.S.  military forces in any way to the jurisdiction of Iraqi criminal courts or punishment under Iraqi law. 
   I think it is very important that we all understand that U.S. military forces are governed by law. They must comply with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and they must comply with the Geneva Conventions. But, currently, U.S. military forces are immune from Iraq's legal system, and Senator Graham and I want to make sure that this will continue to be the case. 
   This policy was set by the Coalition Provisional Authority, Order No. 17, and it is supported by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546. But here is the reason we think it is important for us to speak out, hopefully, with a uniform voice today. Last month, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said this policy should change. He is the Prime Minister of Iraq. He said:  
   We believe that the immunity given to international forces is what emboldens them to commit such crimes in cold blood. This requires that such immunity should be reconsidered.  
   So the Prime Minister said that this immunity from his laws ought to be reconsidered. It seems, in a difficult time in Iraq--and Lord knows we won't get into all of it--where there is disagreement among the factions there, everyone seems to agree that, in fact, changing this policy to ensure that American troops are under the Iraqi court's jurisdiction is a good idea. They think it is a good idea. We do not, and we want to make sure it does not happen. 
   Prime Minister Maliki also suggested that the Iraqi Parliament review the policy of immunity for American troops. Let's look at what the Iraqi Parliament is saying about U.S. troops. 
   I want to make sure we understand. It is not every member of the Parliament but some members of the Iraqi Parliament. And let's keep in mind we have lost in excess of 2,500 troops there. They are gone, never to come home again. Every day, sadly--it feels like every day--I have to write a condolence letter to someone who lost a son or daughter. We now have in excess of 19,000 wounded. We know that we have a third of our soldiers coming back in the first year seeking mental health help. We know we have a lot of our soldiers experiencing post-traumatic stress. We have given, and taxpayers are still giving--it is the gift that keeps on giving--money, billions of dollars, and the lives of our soldiers, and wounded soldiers--all the rest. 
   So when we hear the Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament Mahmoud al-Mashhadani say, ``The U.S. occupation is butcher's work under the slogan of democracy, human rights and justice''--and this is someone who was part of the government, was part of the package when they put together that government--when we hear those words, we not only take tremendous offense at those words, we not only get sick about those words, whether we supported this war or voted against it, we want to make sure that not one of our soldiers comes under the jurisdiction of an Iraqi court with political statements behind it like that. 
   Let me tell you what else the Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament said. He called for statues to be built for those who kill American soldiers, saying:  
   I personally think whoever kills an American soldier in defense of his country should have a statue built for him in that country.  
   This makes me sick, to think that we are still there, year after year after year. Now, in my opinion--and I certainly do not speak for someone else when I say this--in this increasingly hostile situation, one that a British leader said was essentially a civil war, imagine us turning over our soldiers to the Iraqi courts when the Speaker of the Parliament, who was part of the Government of Iraq, says:  
   Whoever kills an American soldier in defense of his country should have a statue built for him in that country.  
   Then you have Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the leader of the dominant Shiite block in Parliament, who called for granting an amnesty for insurgents who had fought against Americans in Iraq--in other words, an amnesty for those who hurt our soldiers--but we should allow our solders, who are fighting for their freedom, to go before an Iraqi court? No way. No way. That is why this amendment is so important today, and I am so pleased that Senator Graham and I have agreed on this. 
   I voted not to go to war. I am working as hard as I can to start bringing our troops home. Senator Graham has different views on this which he will express. But on the issue of our troops being tried in an Iraqi court system, we are in full agreement. 
   This amendment is necessary because on July 6, the Washington Post reported:  
   An Iraqi government official, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, said Mr. Maliki hoped to revise Order No. 17 when the United Nations resolution authorizing the presence of American forces in Iraq is up for renewal at the end of the year.  
   Of course, that order is the order I referred to at the beginning of my comments which protects our troops from being tried in an Iraqi court. 
   It is critical that Congress be heard on this issue. I am very hopeful that we will be heard loud and clear, and I am expecting that we will. 
   Senator Graham and I also agree that those who commit crimes have to be held accountable for their crimes. Of course we do. But as I said before, there is the Uniform Code of Military Justice and there are the Geneva Conventions. Our people must be held accountable for their actions, but we cannot subject our men and women in uniform to an Iraqi judicial system that is in chaos and, frankly, an Iraqi country that is in chaos. 
   Iraq's own Deputy Justice Minister has admitted that Iraqi prisons are overrun with Shiite Muslim militiamen who have freed fellow members convicted of major crimes and have executed Sunni Arab inmates. In Basra, it was reported that militia members took 12 foreign-born prisoners from their cells and shot them in the head. One Iraqi parliamentarian has said he saw as many as 120 detainees packed into a 35-by-20-foot cell, many who claimed they had been raped and their families tortured. We are not going to have Americans in any way get close to that situation over there. 
   U.S. personnel must not be subjected to the Iraqi legal system, especially when you consider that under Iraq's constitution, experts in Islamic jurisprudence can sit on the supreme court even if they have no training in civil law or other relevant subjects. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom reports that ``such limited training places Iraq's supreme court requirements alongside those of Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran.'' We are not going to let our soldiers get close to that. 
   Everyone on both sides--all of us, whether we are for this war or against this war--voted yes. We all pray and hope that some day in Iraq there will be a governing body that will bring order, that will bring democracy, that will be respected, and we all hope things don't go in a bad direction. But I tell you today that my view is it is very tough over there. I just told you about some of the things that are happening in their criminal justice system. We can't allow U.S. military personnel to be subjected to Iraq's legal system. 
   Just this morning, GEN John Abizaid told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ``sectarian violence is probably as bad as I have seen it.'' He said that today in the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
   It was reported today that the outgoing British Ambassador to Iraq wrote a confidential memo to Prime Minister Tony Blair saying that ``the prospect of a low intensity civil war and a de facto division of Iraq is probably more likely at this stage than a successful and substantial transition to a stable democracy.'' That is a very disheartening thing for the American people to hear. 
   Things are very tough--as tough as they have ever been in Iraq. This is certainly not the time to leave any impression out there whatsoever that this is the time we could say that our soldiers would be somehow trapped inside the Iraqi legal system. 
   The Boxer-Graham amendment makes common sense. U.S. military personnel must be held accountable for their actions, but not by the Iraqi Government, by the U.S. Code of Military Justice, by the Geneva Conventions. 
   I am very proud to be working with my friend on this issue. I yield the floor and hope that at this time, he would be recognized to make his comments as to why we have come together on this important amendment

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator FEINSTEIN and I would like to thank the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii for their outstanding leadership on this bill and especially for their dedication to ensuring that our Nation's combat-wounded service members receive the best possible services and care. 
   I would like to ask both Senators to work with us during conference negotiations in support of funding for the Northern California Institute of Research and Education, NCIRE. 
   This funding will support the work of the Neuroscience Center of Excellence at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center--a state-of-the-art facility dedicated to the diagnosis, prevention, and management of neurodegenerative diseases, brain and spinal cord injuries, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, that occur in U.S. warfighters. 
   I had the privilege of recently visiting NCIRE. Let me tell you, the work they are doing is cutting-edge and absolutely vital to our Nation's warfighters and veterans. They are developing new ways to diagnose and treat PTSD in an effort to ensure that our more recent veterans do not share the same fate as so many of those from earlier conflicts, including Vietnam. I had the honor of meeting a Vietnam veteran during my visit to NCIRE who told me that he just got his life back because of NCIRE's work. This is a man who served his country and came back to spend much of his time jobless, homeless, and without hope. NCIRE is working to make sure that our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans do not share the same fate.

   My amendment simply encourages agencies to add a disclaimer to those prepackaged news stories that says ``Paid for by the United States Government.'' 
   This is very important for the taxpayers to know it is their money that is being spent. I hope and I wish the other side would agree to this amendment. If not, I guess we will have to have a vote.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to support the budget point of order on S. 852. I want to explain why I am doing this. 
   First, I want to say if anybody has listened to Senator KENT CONRAD talk about what is going to happen in the outyears with this bill, the trust fund, if anyone listened to him, it seems very difficult to me to vote against this budget point of order. 
   We are on the edge of passing a bill that is masquerading as a solution to a deadly problem, and asbestos victims need to know the truth. Frankly, they were lied to once when companies exposed their workers to asbestos without telling them of the danger, and I don't want to lie to these victims again. The simple truth is there are not sufficient funds in the trust fund to compensate all the current and future asbestos victims. We should not compound the problem of the past by offering false promises and cutting victims off from help. 
   I know there are many who don't agree with what I have just said, but I think if, again, you listen to Senator Conrad, and you go back to see what has happened to other trust funds, I think it is very clear there are not enough funds in this trust fund. Some estimates are it is perhaps 50 percent of what it ought to be. 
   Some say that people will go back to court if there are not enough funds. I know that is a very well meaning part of this bill, but it isn't as easy as all that. It is going to be very difficult for people in the future years. I think we are going to see more companies claim they are bankrupt. There will be a lot of lawsuits. 
   That is not to say there is no problem for asbestos victims today. Providing them with just compensation is something they deserve. If we were able to increase the size of the fund and include all of the victims who deserve to be compensated, that would be a good solution. I know this is what many honorable and hard-working Senators on both sides have tried to do, but the current legislation doesn't get us there. 
   Asbestos kills 10,000 Americans every year. Such a large number of deaths is hard to comprehend, so let me tell my colleagues about just a few of the victims in California and why this bill will hurt them, not help them. 
   Here is a picture of Rebecca Martinez. Rebecca is the wife of Margarito who lived in Baldwin Park, CA, and she is pictured here on the right. Margarito worked as a plasterer and Rebecca would clean his asbestos-covered clothes when he came home, breathing in the dust as she shook them out and did the laundry. They were never warned about the dangers of asbestos. 
   Rebecca was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2002, as we all know, a deadly cancer caused only by asbestos. She died 4 months later, leaving behind her husband and three children. 
   Her husband has spent more than $50,000 on a pending wrongful death suit. However, if this bill is passed, he will never get to go to court and face the people who are responsible for his wife's death. This bill will force him back to square one, and he will face, potentially, years of delay. And here he is, a widower having to raise his kids. 
   For those who are about to resolve their court cases, I see no reason to force them into a trust fund process. It is wrong. People have invested time in the court system, and this bill will rip them out of the court system just as they are about to get justice. 
   This is a picture of Georgina Bryson. She lived in Riverside, CA, when she died of mesothelioma. From 1962 until 1980, Georgina lived downtown from two cement companies that used asbestos to manufacture their products. Georgina was also exposed to asbestos when she lived with her dad who worked with gaskets that contained asbestos.  
   Georgina was only 40 years old when she died from mesothelioma. Her family filed a wrongful death action and, to the credit of the California court system--to the credit of the California court system--the suit settled. The cement plants agreed to pay 90 percent of the award, recognizing that they were primarily responsible for the death.  
   The problem with the legislation before us is, if Georgina's family didn't have access to the courts, and they filed the claim with the asbestos fund, they could receive possibly no compensation. Because Georgina's asbestos exposure was not work related, she lived downwind from the cement manufacturers, she would not meet the occupational requirements of the bill. 
   There are many people in California and elsewhere who never worked with asbestos but were exposed to it because they lived near factories, mines, and processing plants with asbestos. This certainly was the case in Libby, MT, and residents of that town are taken care of in the bill. That is a wonderful thing for them. Lord knows there is suffering there. The exposure requirements for anyone who lived or worked for at least 12 months within 20 miles of the mining or milling facility in Libby are waived, so the people in Libby are taken care of, and I am happy for them. But the bill fails to provide the same relief to people in at least 41 other communities across the country who live near a plant that processed vermiculite from Libby. How is that equal justice under the law? It also fails to protect people who lived near other mines or plants that released asbestos into the air. 
   For example, Santa Ana is one of roughly 23 cities in California that received more than 1 million tons of Libby's vermiculite. Yet this bill would compound the injuries to affected community members by largely barring nonoccupational exposures. As I said, no one can call this justice. 
   The bill also fails to adequately address another problem important to my State, as well as the Nation--naturally occurring asbestos. I am going to show you a map of California where we show the counties containing naturally occurring asbestos. Forty-four of California's 58 counties are known to have naturally occurring asbestos. The problem, however, is not California specific. Twenty-nine States are known to have naturally occurring asbestos. 
   This asbestos can threaten public health. This shows in red where the States have this problem with naturally occurring asbestos. In 2005, a University of California-Davis study found that the risk of mesothelioma decreased by 6.4 percent for every 6 miles further away a person lived from a naturally occurring asbestos source. 
   Under the bill, people who get a terminal illness from naturally occurring asbestos may take their case to the medical exceptions panel, but there are three problems. 
   First, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for getting that into the bill. At least they can go to this special panel. But there are problems. First, the level of funding established by the bill for the trust fund, as I said before, is insufficient to pay for the claims expected to be filed with the exceptional medical claims panel. It is insufficient. There wouldn't be funding left. 
   The CBO stated in a letter on February 1 to Senator Specter that:  
   There is a significant likelihood that the fund's revenues would fall short of the amount needed to pay valid claims, debt service, and administrative costs.  
   This is, in part, because the CBO explicitly stated that it did not include ``the costs of any exceptional medical claims'' in its estimate. What kind of chance do my people have for being exposed to naturally occurring asbestos  and the people who live in all of these States? 
   This isn't justice. If we want to do justice, we need a bill that is sufficiently funded through the trust fund to take care of all of our people, not just some of our people. 
   The Democratic staff of the Budget Committee predicts a shortfall in the trust fund of $150 billion or more. That is $150 billion that taxpayers may have to pay to bail out the trust fund. It is easy to say: Oh, you will just go back to the courts. But that is a time period in which we don't know what the situation will look like, more companies will claim bankruptcy, and people will then have to move from the trust fund over to the courts. It is a giant nightmare. 
   Second, it is not clear that the companies paying into the fund should be the ones responsible for compensating people who become sick from naturally occurring asbestos. Construction companies disturbing naturally occurring asbestos may expose residents to fibers, but those companies are generally not the ones paying into the fund. So this makes no sense at all for people who live in areas with naturally occurring asbestos. They are different defendants that need to step up and pay compensation. 
   Third, there is no deadline by which the medical exceptions panel must act on a claim. Given the number of people who may file claims with the panel, it could be years before the panel makes a decision on a particular case. Is this better than the current court system? 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for just 2 more minutes.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I don't think it is better than the current court system, certainly not in my State. In California, we have an expedited processing of suits for sick plaintiffs. Roughly 22 States have procedures that ensure mesothelioma victims and those with other very serious cancers have their cases heard in a year or less. In California the courts can hear such cases within 120 days. There are States where the courts work, and they should be allowed to continue their good work without getting taxpayers involved in this trust fund. Where it is working, do no harm. Let it proceed. 
   Most, if not all, of us could support an asbestos trust fund that is fair to victims, but this proposal is not. I have gone through the ways that it is not. I have shown my colleagues the faces of those who would be harmed or would have been harmed if this trust fund were in place. 
   We can fix this. We can make the trust fund bigger, that is one solution, or we can say in the 22 States that are dealing with this, let them deal with it. Let's grandfather in the cases that are already in the system. 
   I am very fearful--very fearful--that a lot of people who are going to depend on this trust fund are going to find out that it isn't what it is cracked up to be. The bill promises the Moon, and I don't even know if it will deliver a sliver of the Moon. 
   I just want to say to those who are following this debate who are suffering, I honestly believe that everybody thinks, everybody thinks they are working for you, but what I say is this: If the system is already working for you, let it work for you. Let's not promise you the Moon and not be able to deliver it. Let's make sure there is justice for people who live, say, downwind in California from a company that received the product from Libby. 
   The people in Libby are taken care of. The people in my State and many other States are not taken care of. This isn't fair. What happened to equal justice? What happened to fairness? We can do it. People of goodwill on both sides can do the right thing. This isn't a question of this bill or no bill. 
   So I honestly think that by supporting this point of order, first of all, we are being honest with the people. We are being honest with the people. We are saying there is not enough money in this trust fund and the taxpayers are going to have to bear the burden and who knows what will happen at that time. With the kind of deficits that are being racked up here, with the kind of national debt that is being racked up here, where is the money going to come from? 
   Some say: Go back to the court system. That is a very complicated matter. Every State has its own way. In some States it works well, like California. In other States, it doesn't. So I urge my colleagues, yes, to protect asbestos victims who may not be so lucky as the people in Libby. Let's take care of the people in Libby, and let's take care of all of the victims and potential victims and vote against waiving this budget point of order. 
   A budget point of order lies against this bill. The Parliamentarian has told us; the CBO has told us. Let's do the honest thing. Let's support the budget point of order, go back to the drawing board. Let's take care of these people and do it in the right way. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to introduce today a bill--cosponsored by Senator Feinstein--to designate a trail in the Headwaters Forest Reserve in California after John L. Burton, one of California's great public servants. The entire California Democratic delegation in the House, led by Representative George Miller, introduced the same bill last week. 
   John served honorably in the United States House of Representatives in the early 1980s and in the California State Assembly, before being elected to the California State Senate. There, in 1998, his colleagues elected him as the California Senate's President Pro Tem. John devoted his career to the service of all Californians, and for that, we honor him with this legislation. 
   Designating this particular trail is a fitting tribute because a few years ago, John was instrumental in protecting the pristine and invaluable land that is now known as the Headwaters Forest Reserve. Comprised of more than 7,000 acres of ancient redwoods, many of which are over 2,000 years old and 300 feet high, the Reserve was saved from potentially devastating logging in 1999. Numerous plant species and wildlife, including the Marbled Murrelet, dwell in this Reserve. The Reserve also protects rivers and streams that provide habitat essential for threatened salmon. 
   For his service to the people of California and his essential role in protecting a priceless parcel of California land, I am proud to introduce the John  L. Burton Trail Act. Through this small action, we recognize and honor a great man and his great work.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today that would ban additional oil and gas drilling in the Los Padres National Forest. My colleague from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, joins me in this effort. Representative CAPPS introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives earlier this month. 
   Los Padres National Forest is on California's central coast, stretching from Monterey County's Big Sur down to Ventura and the western edge of Los Angeles County. Covering almost 1.75 million acres, it is California's third-largest national forest and one of the State's most visited. Los Padres National Forest is an ecological treasure and a recreational refuge in one of California's, indeed America's, most densely populated areas. 
   It provides habitat for 20 threatened and endangered wildlife species, including the spectacular California condor. Los Padres also contains unexplored archaeological sites that contain Native American historical artifacts. 
   Yet, despite these facts and strong local opposition to oil and gas drilling in the Forest, the Forest Service announced today that it will open up more than 52,000 acres of land to oil and gas drilling in Los Padres National Forest. While this is far less land than the Forest Service previously considered opening, additional drilling is simply unacceptable. That is why I am introducing legislation to prevent this new drilling, and any future drilling from occurring in Los Padres National Forest. 
   Additional oil and gas drilling will threaten the pristine and unspoiled lands in the Forest. It could damage or destroy Native American artifacts. And, it could ruin recreational opportunities by contaminating streams and increasing air pollution. 
   My legislation is a critical step toward protecting the irreplaceable natural, cultural, and recreational resources of the Los Padres National Forest. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy, from the bottom of my heart, for his words about this extraordinary young woman; more than that, to him and his staff for believing in her. That took a leap of faith, that a woman so young could come in and present as compelling a case as she did. 
   Of course, she went right to the Senator, that is for sure, because of the work he has done for human rights in the world. She knew what she was doing. But you heard her and Tim and you rolled up your sleeves and created a program that the entire Senate backed and the entire Congress backed to help the innocent victims of war--those who are unfortunately sometimes called ``collateral damage''; we have names for that. 
   Clearly, what Marla did, by recognizing that these people needed help, she was doing God's work. But she also, as the good Senator pointed out, was helping the United States of America because we are in the battle for the hearts and minds of the world. Marla understood that.

   Mrs. BOXER. My amendment would increase funding for jamming devices that would deactivate roadside bombs. They are one of the leading causes of the casualties in Iraq. 
   Mr. President, I will get back to the tribute I want to give to Marla. I thank Laura Schiller, my staff member, who is sitting here with me. She helped me put together these remarks. She was a friend of Marla's, and it was very hard for her to get through writing these remarks. 
   This morning, in northern California, where I was--I just got here--the people woke up to the San Francisco Chronicle's front page. It is this magnificent picture of Marla and a little girl she helped, along with an Iraqi woman who had clearly also been working with this little child. 
   It is interesting because on either side of this beautiful photograph of Marla and this little girl are two very negative stories about the world we live in--Medicare fraud and oil companies trying to lower their taxes in light of their highest profits ever--and it just spoke to me about Marla because there she was in the middle of all these negative forces, the worst kinds of negative forces--war, hatred, sectarian violence, all these things, there she was right in the middle, something good for us to cling to. 
   My heart breaks for Marla's family and her friends. Some of them were here, so many whose lives she touched. One of Marla's friends was my daughter Nicole who called me with the news of Marla's death on Saturday night. It was hard to understand her at first, so heavy were her tears. Between sobs, she told me Marla had been killed along the treacherous road leading to the Baghdad airport. It was a road so dangerous that when Senators travel there--and I just got back from there a couple weeks ago--they don't go on that road. Instead, they go on a Blackhawk helicopter and speed through a city with machine guns on either side looking down to the ground. It is a road so dangerous that even limited protection costs thousands of dollars--tens of thousands of dollars just to go one way on that road, if you were to hire people to help protect you. That is how dangerous it is. 
   Who among us would have found the courage to travel on that road on Saturday, or the road that Marla had traveled during her courageous, committed, and very short life? Who among us can say we have spent so much of our lives serving other people in the way that truly makes a difference? How many 28-year-olds can say that? 
   Imagine, in this the most powerful and greatest country in the world, it was this remarkable woman who went door to door counting Iraqi civilian victims, when nobody else would. It was this young woman who lobbied the Senate for assistance for these families, and we heard from Senator Leahy about how incredible she was when she made the case. She risked her own life to make sure they received the support they deserved. 
   ``Marla was something close to a saint,'' one friend wrote this morning, ``but a very realistic saint.'' I personally met Marla for the first time recently when she and her mother came to my home in California to celebrate an occasion for my daughter. When Marla walked through our front door with her mom, she had an infectious smile, and my daughter's face lit up. ``This is the amazing woman I've been telling you about, Mom,'' she said. 
   This is how it always was for the thousands around the world lucky enough to call Marla a friend. It didn't matter if you lived in the streets of Baghdad or the dusty villages of Afghanistan or the corridors of power in  Washington, DC. It didn't matter whether you knew Marla. She would come up to you and you would feel as if you had known her for a lifetime. 
   She treated every conversation as a chance to tell you about the righteousness of her cause, and she treated everyone with the same respect, openness, and unconditional love. 
   We so often hear:  
   And now three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.  
   My office was flooded today with e-mails and phone calls from the people whose lives were touched by Marla's faith, hope, and love. Everyone has a story to tell, and I brought a few photos to share with you because words are not enough. 
   In this photo she sent hours before her death, we see her holding tightly an Iraqi child who was thrown from a vehicle just before it was blown up in a rocket attack. The child's entire family was killed. Marla saved that child. 
   Here we see one of the countless civilians brutally injured and now beaming and healthy next to the person, Marla, who helped her heal. 
   We see Marla's trusted Iraqi colleague, Faiz, whom she wrote, ``was sent to me by angels from the sky.'' He worked tirelessly beside her, and he died bravely beside her. 
   And we see this beautiful, vibrant, young woman, red scarf around her neck, surrounded by the soldiers she befriended and entreated in her quest to help Iraqi 
   civilians. Senator Leahy made the point that everyone wanted to help Marla--everyone. The U.S. military wanted to make up for the damage that was caused. They desperately wanted to do that, but they needed someone who could give them accurate information, and she did that. 
   Inside the green zone--  
   One friend wrote last night--  
   she would encourage military officers and U.S. officials to hug each other--just to remember that they were still human, and reward them with a big smile if they actually did it.  
   There are many other pictures that her friends wanted to share of a woman who was a great friend to all and a beloved Ambassador for the United States at a time when our actions may not be so popular. 
   There were images of the notes she sent, when their spirits were at their lowest, telling them how beautiful they are, how much their work mattered, how much she cared. 
   I think we are going to leave this picture up because it is exquisite. There are other pictures of Marla sleeping on the floor for nights on end so she could use her limited resources to help Iraqi victims. Behind her happy-go-lucky demeanor, there was a picture of an effective advocate cornering a Defense Secretary, a general, or, yes, a U.S. Senator, and refusing to go away until our country helped care for the innocent victims of war. 
   There was a picture of the room full of journalists waiting that last night for their host to show up for another party she had planned to buoy their spirits, and no doubt try to persuade them to write about the victims she saw suffering terrible damage--not collateral damage but critical damage. 
   A few days before she died, Marla wrote her own op-ed for the Washington Post. She talked about her most recent discovery--that the U.S. military was counting Iraqi civilian casualties in some places, despite its claims to the contrary. She ended with these words:  
   ..... To me, each number is a story of someone whose hopes, dreams, and potential will never be realized, and who left behind a family.  
   The same can be said of Marla. Her hopes, her dreams, and her potential will never be realized, and she left behind a family. In all the years I have lived, I do not know too many people who have made an impact the way she has in those 28 short years. But I guarantee you, if Marla were here, she would not want us to weep, she would not want us to hide our heads. She would want us to keep fighting for the people and causes she had championed even before she was old enough to drive a car. She would want us to remember the words of encouragement and action she sent constantly to friends and colleagues. Once she wrote, ``Their tragedies are my responsibilities,'' and now her work must be ours. 
   I hope a message goes out to the suicide bombers to stop what they are doing, to stop it now, and to those who would put together these roadside bombs to stop it now because everyone who is injured by this--everyone--has hopes and dreams and families and potential. 
   So her work must be ours. She was the voice of these victims to whom no one seems to pay much attention. We need to be her voice now. 
   ``And now these three remain: Faith, hope and love: But the greatest of these is love.'' 
   Mr. President, may we join the grieving Ruzicka family and thousands around the world in paying tribute to a young woman of great faith, hope, and love by finishing the work she so courageously began and by working to make sure this war will soon come to an end. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Secure Nuclear Facilities Act of 2006, which addresses an unacceptable gap in our Nation's homeland security. My bill would hold commercial nuclear powerplants to the same high security standards to which government nuclear facilities are subject. 
   There are currently 104 nuclear powerplants licensed to operate in the United States, including two plants, with two reactors each, in my home state of California. 
   These plants are potential targets for terrorists, and we are not doing enough to ensure they are protected. The 9/11 Commission report, issued on July 22, 2004, stated that nuclear powerplants were among the targets considered in the original plan for the September 11, 2001, attacks. 
   An attack on a nuclear plant would be disastrous. The meltdown of a nuclear powerplant's nuclear reactor core, release of the spent nuclear fuel located at the site, removal from the site of radioactive materials, or other violation of the plant's security would greatly endanger public health and safety. Unfortunately, there are reports of nuclear plant operators' failure to effectively address vital security issues, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's failure to hold them sufficiently accountable. 
   To make matters worse, commercial nuclear plant operators are not currently required to defend their plants against theft and diversion of nuclear material. Nonweapon nuclear facilities operated by the government, on the other hand, are required to defend against not only direct attacks, but also theft and diversion of nuclear material. This double standard makes no sense. 
   Commercial nuclear plants contain materials that terrorists might attempt to steal, just like government nuclear facilities. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, concedes that terrorists might use these highly radioactive materials in a radiological bomb or, with the right equipment, reprocess it into weapons-grade material. But according to the NRC, it is not reasonable to expect a private facility to cope with this threat, because private facilities do not have the same resources as government facilities. 
   The NRC's argument is deeply flawed. If nuclear plant owners and operators cannot address the full spectrum of terrorist threats they face, then they should not be in business. There is too much at stake in terms of the dangers posed by these threats for us to allow continued low security standards for commercial nuclear plants. 
   My bill would require commercial nuclear plants to defend against the same potential threats as government nuclear facilities, including threat and diversion of nuclear materials. The bill would also strengthen State and local responders' ability to aid nuclear plants in case of an attack by terrorists. It offers grants to State and local responders to facilitate evacuations and medical treatment, as well as interoperable communications among first responders and plant operators. 
   The Secure Nuclear Facilities Act of 2006 would make our country safer by ensuring better security at commercial nuclear plants. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you so much for your courtesy--and my colleagues. I wanted to be heard on this bill. I haven't spoken on it. It is a bill that I call a drilling bill; I don't call it an energy bill. I rise to speak against it, and I am against it for three very simple reasons. 
   First, I have no assurances--nor does Senator Feinstein--that the California coast will continue to be protected from new offshore oil and gas drilling. That protection is crucial to my State, to my State's economy, and, of course, it is crucial to the promise that we made to our children and our grandchildren--that this coast will be forever protected. It is one of God's greatest gifts to our State. Every history book that writes about California talks about the beauty of our State--and it starts with the ocean. We know if we lose that beauty it is irreplaceable. 
   I also wanted to make a point to my friends that in our State, offshore oil drilling is an issue that unites the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats. They do not want to see it happen, whether it is our Governor or our Democratic candidate for Governor. They are in full agreement. This is an issue that unites California. 
   Clearly, we know that our economy is heavily reliant on tourism. It is reliant on fisheries. And offshore oil drilling threatens both of those economic engines. 
   Second, this bill will drain billions of dollars from the Federal Treasury. That is indisputable. And it does nothing to help us meet the critical goal of reducing America's dependence on oil. As a matter of fact, this bill deepens our dependence on oil. 
   Achieving real energy independence must be more than just a slogan. In this unbalanced bill, we admit our addiction to oil. As a matter of fact, I heard many colleagues say we need more oil, that we need this oil. But with this bill, we continue to feed this habit. 
   I personally believe there are places in this country where you can drill off the coast. I respect Senator Landrieu very much, and I don't have a problem if there is unanimity that there ought to be drilling off her state's coast. And I support her efforts to have some conservation fund to restore the area. But what are we getting on the other side? We are getting drilling, we are feeding the addiction to oil. It seems to me we are getting nothing because we are not allowed to amend this bill with some forward-thinking amendments. We are getting, for sure, a greater and greater deficit and a greater and greater debt. 
   How would we better balance this bill? We should promote vehicle technologies that get better gas mileage. We can develop and incentivize the use of alternative fuels. We can encourage energy conservation. 
   We have seen countries such as Brazil just within a 10-year timeframe become independent of foreign oil--become energy independent. But guess what. Because the Republican leadership won't allow it, we cannot offer any amendments to alter this bill. It is either drilling and giving four States a ton of money to reward them for that, causing the Federal deficit to swell, or it is nothing.  
   It is sad because this is a great country. It is a country of great ideas. Yet the ideas on both sides of the aisle take a back seat to the same old, same old, drill, drill, drill. 
   We can't drill our way out of this problem. As tempting as the mirage of a quick fix might be, we must not endanger the California coast with new drilling. And that is what will happen if this bill is merged with the House drilling bill. 
   If the House would take the Senate bill, then I would breathe a sigh of relief for my State--and the west coast and the east coast can also breathe a sigh of relief. But we don't have any assurances that the Pombo bill, which will open up the door to drilling in the most beautiful areas, will not become part of this bill. 
   Let me tell you that Californians--again, across party lines--rejected coastal drilling long ago. Even in the days when our State was a red State, we rejected offshore oil drilling across party lines. 
   It was because we had a devastating Santa Barbara rig blowout that contaminated our ocean waters and beaches almost 40 years ago. The memories of that are still ever present. The memories of that also became a warning sign that we want to preserve our precious coast. 
   The people of California decided that the potential benefits of future offshore oil and gas development were not worth the risk of destroying our priceless coastal treasures and our most important tourist industry that draws millions and millions to our coast. 
   I ask anyone listening to this debate: Is there a time when you visit California that you don't go to the coast? Everyone comes to our coast. What you do there is observe the wonder of an unspoiled coastline. There are certain areas where we do have drilling. But for many years we have kept the moratorium in place. When you go to our coastline, from the very far north of the State, down to the south, what you see is God's beauty. When you come to our State and you stay in our beautiful hotels and our bed and breakfasts and go to our restaurants, often having a view of our ocean, you can't help but come away in awe that this is a gift that has been given to us, and a gift that we must preserve. It brings dollars to our State. 
   This is one of those times when it is the right thing to do economically to keep that coast beautiful. It is the right thing to do spiritually. And, it is the right thing to do environmentally. 
   The California State legislature understands it. In 1994 they passed a law that permanently prohibits oil and gas exploration in our State's waters. I thank them for that. We learned the lesson that drilling is dangerous. We learned it the hard way. 
   The Senate bill, if it is merged with the House bill, could be disastrous for the California environment and economy. We know it is disastrous for the Federal Treasury. By the year 2017, four States in our Nation would be entitled to $590 million per year; by 2022, $1.2 billion per year. These States will get part of the Federal Treasury. We cannot afford this kind of imbalanced fiscal policy at a time when the Federal deficit is expected to be $300 billion this year and the national debt is over $8.4 trillion and growing. 
   I think back to the year that President Clinton left office. The budget projections were that we were going to be debt free. Since my friends on the other side have taken control, deficits are back in full bloom. The debt is back and this bill adds to the debt and the deficit. How could we possibly do that today? Sadly, we are not only doing it with the energy bill, we are doing it in another bill I will talk about in a minute. 
   How about this? No amendments allowed to this bill. What is the other side afraid of? We might have an amendment that will pass? We might have an amendment that increases fuel economy for our automobiles? We might have an amendment that makes sure we have flex-fuel vehicles? We might have an amendment pass that invests in cellulosic ethanol so we can have more farmers get into this act and produce ethanol from products other than corn? That would not use up as much energy to produce. 
   Americans are paying $3 per gallon at the pump. By the way, in my State, in San Diego, I saw gas at over $4 for full serve. Talk about sticker shock, picture that one. There is not one thing in this bill about going after the gougers. What are they afraid of on the other side of the aisle? That we will go after the people who are essentially holding us up at the pump every single day? 
   They say the gas prices are going through the roof because of unrest in the Middle East and Nigeria and companies are simply passing along higher costs. If that were true, it would be one thing. It isn't true. How do we know? 
   While the American people are suffering, the oil companies are raking in record profits. If this were simply about passing along higher costs, the oil companies' profits would be flat. 
   I used to be an economics major. It is pretty basic. If you are passing along costs, your profits are flat. But if you are passing along costs plus a huge increase in profit, your profits are up. 
   Yes, Senator Cantwell, who had a great provision to go after the gougers, was not allowed to offer it as an amendment. 
   Oil executives prosper. We have seen them, by the way, come before our committee. Senator Cantwell and I tried to swear them in. The Republican chairman would not allow us to swear in the oil company executives. I found that to be a bit disgraceful. So they were not under oath. By the way, they did not tell the truth, either. The fact is, transportation fuel costs for families have doubled since the Bush administration has taken office. Yet we cannot offer an amendment to go after the oil companies because the Republicans, who run the House, who run the Senate, and run the White House, do not want the oil companies to face the music. Pretty simple. 
   I thought we were a country of, ``by and for the people.'' It turns out we are a country of, ``by and for the oil companies.'' You do not learn that in your textbooks. 
   We have to do better. Democrats have written a bill called the Clean EDGE Act that would require increases in flex-fuel vehicle production, that would make price gouging a Federal crime, would provide incentives for manufacturing hybrid cars, and would set minimum fuel economy standards for tires. 
   Why do you need standards for tires? Efficient tires on cars and keeping them inflated to the proper pressure improve mileage and would cut oil consumption by 160 million barrels per year. But we cannot offer an amendment. No, we cannot offer an amendment. They are protecting the oil companies. Why are we surprised? The President is an oil man. The Vice President is an oil man. 
   My Democratic colleagues and I have worked with Republicans to raise CAFE standards. That is the corporate average fuel economy. That is what CAFE is. The Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act would raise CAFE standards for all vehicles, including SUVs, from 25 miles per gallon to 35 by 2017. This is a bill written by my colleagues, Senator Feinstein and Senator Snowe, but they cannot offer their amendment. Why? Because the Republicans want to protect the oil companies as the price for gas goes up. 
   By closing the SUV loophole, we could save the equivalent of one Alaska National Wildlife Refuge every 7 years. We do not have to drill our way out of this crisis in the God-given wild places. We just need to be a little smarter. We can do it. 
   I had amendments I would have offered that would have said the Federal Government has to purchase the most fuel-efficient vehicles available. It is kind of a no-brainer, but I cannot offer it. The President could issue an Executive Order today requiring that. He won't do that because he supports the oil companies, folks. Follow it, all of it; it leads back to that one point. 
   The average fuel economy of the Federal fleet was an abysmal 21.4 miles per gallon. I have had, for many years, a hybrid car. The new model, if it is driven properly, gets over 50 miles per gallon. Surely, we can do better than 21.4 miles a gallon. 
   I would have offered an amendment to promote research for cellulosic ethanol, a type of fuel produced by agricultural waste. Promoting this innovative fuel will reduce our dependence on oil and provide our Nation's farmers with new income sources. No, I could not offer it because they are protecting the oil companies. It all comes back to that.  
   With no amendments, we have a narrow drilling bill that busts the budget. We had an opportunity to work together across the aisle and come up with a comprehensive energy bill. But instead, we are going to protect the oil companies. 
   So we have more of the same failed policies that, in the end, could, in fact, endanger all of our coasts. 
   Once again, we call on the Republican leadership to start standing up for an energy policy for this country; not a narrow drilling bill that busts the Federal budget but an energy policy that will save the budget of the American people and help our economy by being on the cutting edge of these technologies. 
   If a country such as Brazil can do it, aren't we a little embarrassed that we can't? We are so far behind, it is extraordinary. I guess when you run the Senate for the oil companies, that is what you get at the end of the day. 
   I find it incredible that this Republican Congress that is supposed to care about fiscal responsibility has thrown fiscal responsibility out the window. 
   You have this bill that will drain the Treasury of over $1 billion a year over time. Then we have this grand compromise in the House headed our way that is going to make changes in the tax laws that impact the top 8,200 wealthiest families in America. It will cut their taxes and, again, rob the Treasury of billions of dollars. Guess what they say. They didn't care too much about that. 
   Let me tell the truth about what is headed our way, folks. The moderates on the House side went over to the leadership and said--these are the Republicans--we need to vote on the minimum wage because we may lose our seats. We are looking crass and cold because we have never had the ability to vote for the minimum wage because you never let us get it through. So we need to pass a minimum wage increase. 
   The leadership said: We have not done that in 10 years. We are not about to do it now. But maybe we could figure out a way to twist that around and cut back on that minimum wage increase and let those people at the bottom of the ladder struggle a bit longer while we give tax breaks to the wealthiest 8,200 families. But we will send it over to the Senate, and if they vote no because they decide they do not want to bust the budget, they will look bad because they have been calling for an increase in the minimum wage. 
   A long time ago when I was a girl, there was a great man who went up against Senator Joe McCarthy. He said to him: Have you no shame? We ought to bring out those words again. I say to my friends, have you no shame? People who work at the minimum wage have not had a raise in almost 10 years. You, Senators, have had a raise almost every year. How about tens of thousands of dollars of raises? 
   Finally, because you are caught between a rock and a hard place, you decide to pass an increase in the minimum wage, but you do it over 3 years. I never heard any Senator say: I will take my raise over 3 years. Never, and we get thousands of dollars in 1 year. I never had a colleague come over from the other side of the aisle against raising the minimum wage, saying: We will take our raise in 3 years. We will wait 3 years for another increase. No, we get our cost-of-living adjustment, while minimum wage workers are going to wait 3 years. 
   By the way, for some the House bill will be a pay cut. Some States, such as my State, where employers cannot reduce the state minimum wage paid just because a worker receives tips, will now be allowed to cut that worker's wages. 
   Have you no shame? Anyone in this Senate live on $10,000 or $11,000 a year? Do you think if you work your fingers to the bone you should be stuck at that level for 10 long years, while people at the top, like us--and, by the way, we are not at the very top, but we are at the top 1 percent or so--we get our cost-of-living adjustments every single year. 
   I have so much respect for working people. I have tried every year since I have been here to give them a pay raise. I want to give them a pay raise where they can hold their head high and support their families, not tell them they have to wait 3 years to get their full increase after being held to $5.15 an hour for 10 years. 
   By the way, there are many Republicans who do not believe in any minimum wage. There are some I have heard who have been here 20 years and have voted against it every time. So if they had their way the minimum wage would be $2.25 an hour. I am waiting for the Republicans to come up and tell me they want to take their cost-of-living adjustment over 3 years. Then I am waiting for them to say, if they have a spouse who works: If my spouse gets a little extra money, I will give back some of my raise--as they have done with their tip policy. 
   I say to those at the very top of the income ladder, the billionaires out there: You are not asking for this. The truth is, many of us here are very willing to say, on the estate tax, that the exemption should be lifted. We have said that. I am on an amendment to do that. Because it is true that the price of houses has gone up, and we do not want to have this estate tax be an onerous burden to anyone--not to a family, not to a farmer--and we can work it out. But what is coming to us in this ``minimum wage train'' is a lot more than an increase in the minimum wage. It is a cruel hoax because it does not give minimum wage workers that raise in a year--after they have waited for 10 years. 
   And for those workers that receive tips, it may actually decrease their wages if they live in one of six states, including California, that doesn't reduce the minimum wage employers must pay because they get tips. And, of course, it is coupled with this big gift to the richest families of America, which means, at the end of the day, millions--hundreds of millions--and eventually billions of dollars will be drained from the Federal Treasury. And the very people who claim to be fiscally responsible are at it again, adding to the deficit, adding to the debt. 
   This is really a time for people to stand up and be counted. This is really a time to speak the truth. This is a tough time in the world. All of us are heartsick about what is going on in the world, and we all pray for an end to the fighting, not only in Lebanon and in Israel but in Iraq where things are deteriorating every single day. Hard times. In the middle of these hard times, is this the time to say to the wealthiest 8,200 families: ``We are worried about you''? 
   And we will have less money for our troops and we will have less money for our kids. This Senate and this Congress has underfunded the No Child Left Behind Act. Oh, everyone said this was the greatest thing since sliced bread. And I voted for it. I really thought George Bush and my Republican friends would fully fund it. I wrote the afterschool section there. We have a million kids on waiting lists. We cannot take them. Funding for that program has been frozen for years now. This President signed the largest increase in student loan costs ever and the biggest cuts in education ever, but they are going to give a big tax break to the richest 8,200 families. I do not get it. I do not think the American people get it. We are going to find out pretty soon. 
   We have an energy bill that Leader FRIST would not let us amend. He is not letting us offer any amendments to slow our oil addiction, to go after the oil companies, to create a bold, new energy policy, get us on the path of energy independence. And then, with Democrats calling for an increase in the minimum wage for 10 years, they give it to us over a 3-year period, when they take their raises to the bank. It is an outrage. Have they no shame? Have they no shame? I do not know. I do not know. 
   I always say here, sometimes I feel like Alice in Wonderland, and I feel that way today. But my voice will be raised on these issues. And the American people will be the judge if these are the kinds of priorities they want: a drilling bill, no energy independence, no antigouging legislation; a minimum wage increase, long overdue, that takes away money from some minimum wage earners; and two budget-busting bills--this one and the one that has the estate tax cut--that are going to add billions and billions to our debt. By the way, in closing, we should know who carries that debt: foreign countries, folks. They pick up the bonds. If they decide to take their money and go home, we are left in a mess.  
   So I hope the American people are listening in on these debates. I look forward to discussing these matters as they come up before the Senate. 
   I thank my colleague very much for his patience.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for a very good and thoughtful debate today on this particular nominee. 
   I come to the Senate today to report and inform my colleagues on the Secretary of State confirmation hearings held in the Foreign Relations Committee last week. 
   By now, everyone knows I posed some very direct questions to Dr. Rice about her statements leading up to the Iraqi war and beyond. As National Security Adviser, Dr. Rice gave confidential advice to the President regarding the war in Iraq. She also made the case for the war in Iraq to the American people through hours of television appearances and commentary. 
   My questions, every one of them, revolved around her own words. As a result of my questions and comments at the hearing, I have been hailed as both a hero and a petty person. I have been called both courageous and partisan. I have been very surprised at this response. Tens of thousands of people signed a petition asking me to hold Dr. Rice accountable for her past statements. 
   The reason I am so surprised at this reaction is that I believe I am doing my job. It is as simple at that. I am on the Foreign Relations Committee. This is a very high profile nominee. This is a Secretary of State nomination in a time of war. My constituents want me to be thorough. They want me to exercise the appropriate role of a Senator. 
   Let's look for a moment at what that role is, how it was defined by our Founding Fathers. Article II, section 2, clause 2, of the Constitution, which I have sworn to uphold, says the President:  
   shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all  other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for.  
   The Cabinet is covered in Article II, section 2, clause 2, of the U.S. Constitution. 
   Now, if you read this, it does not say anywhere in here that the President shall nominate and the Senate shall confirm. It says the President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate'' shall make the appointments. 
   Why is it our Founders believed it was crucial for the Senate to play such a strong role in the selection of these very important and powerful members of the administration and members of the bench? It is because our Founders believed that the executive branch must never be too powerful or too overbearing. 
   In Federal No. 76, Alexander Hamilton wrote:  
   It will readily be comprehended that a man who had himself the sole disposition of offices would be governed much more by his private inclinations and interests than when he was bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a different and independent body .....  
   In today's vernacular, any President needs a check and balance. That certainly applies today, and it would apply to a Democratic President as much as to a Republican President. 
   Our Founders are clear, and the Constitution is clear. Again, it does not say anywhere in the Constitution that a President, Democratic or Republican, has free rein in the selection of his or her Cabinet. That is exactly what the Founders did not want. They wanted the President, and I will quote Alexander Hamilton again, to ``submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and determination of a different and independent body.'' And that body is the Senate. 
   It also doesn't say anywhere in the Constitution that the only reason for a Senator to vote no on a Presidential nominee is because of some personal or legal impediment of that nominee. It leaves the door open. Senators have to ponder each and every one of these nominations. It is very rare that I step forward 
   to oppose one. I have opposed just a couple. I have approved hundreds. 
   Let me be clear. I will never be deterred--and I know my colleagues feel the same, I believe, on both sides of the aisle--I will never be deterred from doing a job the Constitution requires of me or it would be wrong to have taken the oath and raise my right hand to God and swear to uphold the Constitution if I did not take this role seriously. 
   I make a special comment to the White House Chief of Staff, who called Members of the Senate petty for seeking time to speak out on this particular nomination. It is important to know that the White House Chief of Staff does a great job for the President, but he does not run the Senate. I know he finds the constitutional requirement of advice and consent perhaps a nuisance, and others have as well in the White House, be they Republicans or Democrats. It is the system of government we have inherited from our Founders. As we go around the world, hoping to bring freedom and liberty to people, we better make sure we get it right here. This is very important, whether it is fair and free elections that really work so people do not stand in line for 10 hours and wait until 4 in the morning to vote, that we fix that, and that we, in fact, act as a check and balance in these nominations. 
   I have been motivated by a lot of people in my life. One of them is Martin Luther King. I wish to share something he said which is not as widely quoted as other things. He said that our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. That is important for everyone to take to heart. Sometimes it is easier to be silent, to just go along, even if in your heart you know there are certain issues that have to be put out on the table. 
   But the fact is, our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. 
   Why does this nomination matter so much to me and to my constituents and to the tens of thousands who signed a petition that they sent to me? It is because we are looking at a Secretary of State nomination in a time of war, someone who is very loyal to this President. And, of course, the President picked someone loyal to him. I do not fault him for that in any way, shape, or form. But what matters is this war. A very strong majority of Americans are worried about this war, and they are worried about what comes next. 
   So, yes, it matters, and it is our job to look at these nominees very seriously. I think it would be terribly condescending to have someone of the caliber of Dr. Rice, with all her intelligence and qualifications and her record of public service with this administration, and not ask the tough questions. That would be condescending. That would be wrong. 
   Now, I am so honored to serve on the Foreign Relations Committee with the Senator from Virginia, who just made a very eloquent talk. I know he would join me in saying that RICHARD LUGAR is one of the fairest chairmen with whom we have ever served. He allowed members on both sides of the aisle to ask any questions they wanted. He supported our right to do so. To me, RICHARD LUGAR is a model chairman. And I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who asked very important questions of this nominee on everything from exit strategy in Iraq, to issues surrounding the torture question, to policies in Latin America, to tsunami relief. All of these colleagues from both sides of the aisle asked very important questions. As for me, I had five areas of questioning, and I want to lay them out briefly for the Senate. 
   Now, one more point as to why I believed it was so important to ask Dr. Rice these questions. I think everyone remembers when Dr. Rice went on television and talked about the mushroom cloud that we could get courtesy of Saddam Hussein--an evil tyrant, absolutely. In my opinion, as I said in the committee, he ought to rot. So let's not get confused on that point. I do not know any American who feels any differently. The question is, How many people had to die? That is an important question. How many people had to be wounded? That is an important question. 
   Let me tell you, 1,368 soldiers are dead, as of the latest numbers that we got this morning from the Department of Defense, and 10,502 wounded. My understanding is that about a third of them may well come home in tremendous need of mental health counseling to try to help them cope with the horrors they have seen, those brave, incredible soldiers. As I said in the committee, and I say it again on the floor of the Senate, not one of them died in vain. Not one of them got injured in vain because when your Commander in Chief sends you to fight in a war, it is the most noble of things to do that. And they have done that. 
   President Bush, in his inaugural address, talked about bringing freedom to countries that do not have it. He did not specify how. Now, the nongovernmental organization, Freedom House, estimates there are 49 countries in the world that are not free. The group believes there are another 54 countries that are considered only partly free. I worry about sending more troops on military missions based on hyped up rhetoric. That is why these questions are so important. 
   So the first set of questions that I posed to Dr. Rice had to do with her comments about Saddam's nuclear program. On July 30, 2003, Dr. Rice was asked by PBS NewsHour's Gwen Ifill if she continued to stand by the claims made about Saddam's nuclear program in the days and months leading up to the war. 
   In what appears to be an effort to downplay the nuclear weapons scare tactics, she said:  
   It was a case that said he is trying to reconstitute. He's trying to acquire nuclear weapons.  
   And then she says:  
   Nobody ever said that it was going to be the next year. .....  
   Well, that was false, because 9 months before that, this is what the President said:  
   If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy, or steal an amount of highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year.  
   So she tells the American people nobody ever said he would have a weapon within a year, when in fact the President himself made that comment. 
   Then, later, a year after she said nobody has ever said this, she herself says it:  
   ..... the intelligence assessment was that he was reconstituting his nuclear programs;  that, left unchecked, he would have a nuclear weapon by the end of the year. .....  
   That is what she says to Fox News. 
   So first she says nobody ever said it. We showed her the fact that the President did. And then she contradicts herself. She contradicts the President and then she contradicts herself. 
   Now, this is very troubling. I wanted to give her a chance to correct the record. Did Dr. Rice correct the record? Let me tell you what she said. She had two responses. First she said to this committee, my committee:  
   The fact is that we did face a very difficult intelligence challenge in trying to understand what Saddam Hussein had in terms of weapons of mass destruction.  
   Notice she does not mention the word ``nuclear weapons.'' And she says: We had a very difficult challenge. But that is a contradiction because on July 31, 2003, this is what she told a German TV station:  
   Going into the war against Iraq, we had very strong intelligence. I've been in this business for 20 years. And some of the strongest intelligence cases that I've seen. ..... We had very strong intelligence going in.  
   So she tells the committee: We faced a difficult intelligence challenge--when she had told a German TV station: It was the best intelligence we ever had. This is contradictory, plus she never ever addresses the issue that we asked her about. Why did you contradict the President and why did she contradict herself? 
   Then she had a second response. She pointed to the Duelfer report and cited it but failed to tell the whole story where the Duelfer report said:  
   Saddam Hussein ended the nuclear program in 1991 following the Gulf War.  
   There you go. She never said that. She never cited that. She cited other quotes from the Duelfer report. 
   So her answers to the questions I asked her, saying once that Saddam would not have a weapon within a year, and another to me saying he would, her answers are completely nonresponsive to the question and raise more credibility lapses. 
   Then we have another area of aluminum tubes. On September 8, 2002, Dr. Rice was on CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer and made this statement:  
   We do know that there have been shipments going ..... into Iraq, for instance, of aluminum tubes that really are only suited to ..... nuclear weapons programs. .....  
   And then President Bush repeated the same thing:  
   Our intelligence sources tell us that (Saddam) has attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.  
   I pointed out to Dr. Rice that the Department of Energy thought otherwise as far back as April 11, 2001. They said the ``specifications [for the tubes] are not consistent with a gas centrifuge end use. .....'' 
   On May 9, 2001, they said:  
   The Intelligence Community's original analysis of these tubes focused on their possible use in developing gas centrifuges for the enrichment of uranium. Further investigation reveals, however, Iraq has purchased similar aluminum tubes previously to manufacture chambers for a multiple rocket launcher.  
   In other words, not suitable for nuclear weapons. 
   Then in July 2002, Australian intelligence said tube evidence is ``patchy and inconclusive.'' And IAEA said they are ``not directly suitable'' for uranium enrichment and are ``consistent'' with making ordinary artillery rockets. 
   So we laid this all out there for Dr. Rice, and she refused again to correct the record. She had a chance. 
   This is what she said at the hearing after she saw all of this:  
   We didn't go to war because of aluminum tubes.  
   That is what she said to the committee. Well, if that is the case, why did President Bush cite the aluminum tubes in his speech in which he made the case for the war? He said:  
   Our intelligence sources tell us that he [Saddam] has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.  
   So you can't say that the aluminum tubes were not a reason for going to war when the President used it in his speech where he was building support for the war. She doesn't answer the question. She doesn't correct the record. It is very troubling. 
   The third issue I raised was the matter of linking Saddam to al-Qaida which she did over and over again. I voted for the war against Osama bin Laden. I believed the President when he said we are going to get him dead or alive. I thought we wouldn't stop--we wouldn't turn away--and that we would not end until we broke the back of al-Qaida. 
   Well, unfortunately, when we went into Iraq--and this was sold to us in part by Dr. Rice; she viewed that as her job; I think the President gave that job to her--we took our eye off al-Qaida. We took our eye off bin Laden. And the consequences are being seen and felt. 
   Dr. Rice told the committee that the terrorists ``are on the run.'' The truth is, they are now in 60 countries when before 9/11 they were in 45 countries. 
   I want to read to you a paragraph that best expresses my views on the impact of the Iraqi war on the war against terrorism. It was written by one of the world's experts on terror, Peter Bergen, 5 months ago:  
   What we have done in Iraq is what bin Laden could not have hoped for in his wildest dreams: We invaded an oil-rich Muslim nation in the heart of the Middle East, the very type of imperial adventure that bin Laden has long predicted was the United States' long-term goal in the region. We deposed the secular socialist Saddam, whom bin Laden long despised, ignited Sunni and Shia fundamentalist fervor in Iraq, and have now provoked a ``defensive'' jihad that has galvanized jihad-minded Muslims around the world. It is hard to imagine a set of policies better designed to sabotage the war on terrorism.  
   This conclusion was supported by the CIA Director's think tank. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD an article that describes this recent report that says Iraq has replaced Afghanistan as the training ground for the next generation of ``professionalized'' terrorists.

   Mrs. BOXER. Here is the thing. Dr. Rice told the American people that there were strong ties between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida. These are her words:  
   We clearly know that there were in the past and have been contacts between senior Iraqi officials and members of al-Qaeda going back for actually quite a long time. 
   And there are some al-Qaeda personnel who found refuge in Baghdad.  
   Now, I want to show a map that the State Department put out, and it was accompanied by a letter from President Bush, a month after 9/11. Here is the map. The red indicates where there are al-Qaida cells. Unfortunately, we notice the United States is red. That is why we have to win this war. This is the list where al-Qaida or affiliated groups have operated, and this is a month after 9/11, put out by this administration. No Iraq. So how do you then go on television, look the American people in the eye, and tell them that in fact--and I will go back to her quote again:  
   We clearly know that there were in the past and have been contacts between senior Iraqi officials and members of al-Qaeda going back for actually quite a long time. 
   And there are some al-Qaeda personnel who found refuge in Baghdad.  
   She did not tell the full story there, and I gave her a chance to do it. 
   It is really troubling to me. After all this time, these are the things she could have said: I never checked out that map. You are right, Senator, there were no al-Qaida there. But she didn't do that. She could have listened to what the experts were saying about how bin Laden loathed Saddam Hussein, two despicable tyrants who hated each other. 
   Peter Bergen said:  
   ..... I met bin Laden in '97 and ..... asked him at the end of the interview ..... his opinion of Saddam Hussein. And [bin Laden] said, ``Well, Saddam is a bad Muslim and he took Kuwait for his own self-aggrandizement.''  
   In November 2001, the former head of the Saudi intelligence said:  
   Iraq doesn't come very high in the estimation of Osama bin Laden. .....He thinks of [Saddam Hussein] as an apostate, an infidel, or someone who is not worthy of being a fellow Muslim.  
   Then the bipartisan 9/11 Commission says there is ``no collaborative'' relationship between Iraq and al-Qaida, and Dr. Rice received that memo on September 18, 2001, and still she went before the American people. When I asked her about it, she said:  
   As to the question of al Qaeda and its presence in Iraq, I think we did say that there was never an issue of operational control ..... that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11 as far as we know or could tell. 
   It wasn't a question of operational alliance. It was a question of an attitude about terrorism that allowed Zarqawi to be in Baghdad and to operate out of Baghdad.  
   Well, those statements continued to mislead. There is no question about it. When she says there wasn't an operational alliance and she believed there never was, why was it that aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln, when President Bush had that famous sign ``mission accomplished,'' he said:  
   The liberation of Iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign against terror. We have removed an ally of al Qaeda.  
   How do you tell the committee that this administration never thought there was an operational link, when the President, standing on the USS Abraham Lincoln, was saying mission accomplished, and the major fighting is behind us? 
   He said:  
   In the war against Saddam, we have removed an ally of al Qaeda.  
   It isn't right to continue this kind of talk when you already know from the 9/11 Commission that it isn't true, and you know from looking at the State Department that it wasn't true. Yet it all continues. 
   In her point about allowing Zarqawi to be in Baghdad, she failed to mention a CIA document that was reportedly sent to the White House in September 2004 that states there is no conclusive evidence that Saddam harbored Zarqawi. 
   Last October, a senior U.S. official told ABC News there was, in fact, no evidence that Saddam even knew Zarqawi was in Baghdad. So we are not being told the whole truth. We are not being given all of the facts. I have to say that I think it is a disservice to the American people. 
   The fourth issue I raised with Dr. Rice concerns U.S. relations with Iran during the Iraq-Iran war. That sounds like, why would I raise that because that war was in the 1980s? It is important because, in making her case for the war in Iraq, Dr. Rice cited Saddam's deplorable use of chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war. It certainly was a sin against humanity. She failed to mention, however, that it was Special Envoy Donald Rumsfeld--here he is in this picture--in December 1983 who met with Saddam 1 month after the United States confirmed he was using chemical weapons almost daily against Iran. In an attempt to support Iraq during that war, Iraq was removed from the terrorism list in 1982. None other than Donald Rumsfeld was giving the good news to Saddam Hussein and tried to restore full diplomatic relations. As a matter of fact, during this whole Iran-Iraq war, we all know the story that American firms were selling materials to Saddam Hussein. 
   Now, this is what Dr. Rice said. She said:  
   I will say it right now. The U.S. Government has often, as the President said, supported regimes in the hope that they would bring stability. We have been in the Middle East sometimes blind to the freedom deficit. We are not going to do that anymore. What happened with Saddam is probably evidence that that policy was not a very wise policy.  
   That is an understatement. It was a horrific policy. It was a terrible policy. It was a policy of appeasing Saddam Hussein, making sure that he had the weapons, because we were essentially taking his side quietly in the Iran-Iraq war, and Donald Rumsfeld was super involved in it, and here is the picture to prove it. 
   Now, I do appreciate that Dr. Rice said it probably was not a very wise policy. I was glad to hear her say that. But you know what. She doesn't explain to us why. When she cited Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran as a justification for the U.S. attack on Iraq, she doesn't mention that the U.S. Government was working at that very same time to reestablish robust relations with Saddam. Indeed, our own Government took Saddam off the terror list, and the American people deserve to know that from her, when she advanced this issue as a reason for the war. Full disclosure. Give the whole story. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I raise the issue of Dr. Rice's opposition to a provision in the intelligence reform bill that would have outlawed the use of cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment of foreign prisoners by intelligence officials. The section of this provision is here. It was passed unanimously by the Senate. The overall amendment was written by Senators MCCAIN and LIEBERMAN, but this particular provision was written by Senator Durbin:  
   Prohibition on torture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment. 
   In general, no prisoner shall be subject to torture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.  
   That is very straightforward. When I asked Dr. Rice, why did you sign a letter with Mr. Bolton and object to this provision and ask that it be stricken, she had a couple of different responses. The first response she gave me was:  
   This is duplicative of language that was in the Defense Department bill.  
   So I checked with the authors of this provision, and I said: Is it true that this is duplicative? They said the language is in the Department of Defense, but it does not apply to the CIA and intelligence officers who work outside of the DOD. So I explained it to her, and she argued with me and she said it is not true, it is duplicative. I said: Do you think Senators McCain, Lieberman, and Durbin don't know what they are doing when they added this to the intelligence bill? She didn't answer. The fact is, this is not duplicative. This is necessary so that we cover those intelligence officials who may not be part of the Department of Defense but are part of other agencies not covered by the Department of Defense. 
   And then she went on and said:  
   We did not want to afford to people who did not--shouldn't enjoy certain protections those protections. And the Geneva Conventions should not apply to terrorists like al-Qaida. They can't or you will stretch the meaning of the Geneva Convention.  
   That was her second problem with it, which was that you are granting more rights than the Geneva Conventions. However, this explanation makes no sense because the following language was also part of this, which is:  
   Nothing in this section shall affect the status of any person under the Geneva Conventions or whether any person is entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions.  
   So she gave two reasons as to why she wrote a letter and demanded this be removed from the intelligence bill, neither of which is true. It is not duplicative, and there is no problem with the Geneva Conventions because we make a special exception for them. 
   But that is not all. The next day, Dr. Rice came back and changed what she said the day before. She said she doesn't oppose the subsection that clearly prohibited torture and cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment. She said she opposes other provisions in the section. 
   Well, Mr. President, this was the operative language of the section. That second day's excuse just doesn't hold up under scrutiny because she wrote in a letter--this is what Dr. Rice wrote to the committee.

   Mrs. BOXER. This says:  
   The administration also opposes [she names the section] which provides legal protections to foreign prisoners to which they are not now entitled under applicable law and policy.  
   And she says that section 1095 of the Defense Authorization Act already addresses this issue. So Dr. Rice's own words in the letter contradict what she told the committee. 
   Now, this issue of torture is one that matters. It matters to me for many reasons. The first is it is about our humanity. It is about our humanity. Second is that it is about our soldiers, who may find themselves in captivity and in a circumstance where they might well get treated the way we are treating people we capture. That is why the protective words here and living up to our treaties or obligations of our Constitution and international treaties are so important. It is not some vague academic discussion; it is very serious. 
   Now, I went and saw, as many colleagues did, the pictures from Abu Ghraib prison. As long as I live, they will be seared in my memory. There are a lot more pictures that the public didn't see. I can tell you--and I think I can say this of most of my colleagues I was sitting with from both sides of the aisle--I could barely watch what was shown. 
   I am sometimes torn to talk about what I saw. I have done it in small groups where my constituents have asked me what I saw, but I will not do it today. I do not want to do it, but let it be said that the kinds of pictures that I saw do not reflect our country or our values. We have to be united on this. 
   Senator Dodd asked Dr. Rice to please tell us her personal views on torture, and he laid out a couple of examples of torture. She demurred and would not respond to those specific questions. I thought that was a moment in time where she could have sent out a signal to the whole world about America. She said for sure that Abu Ghraib was terrible. She was eloquent on the point. In fact, I will read to my colleagues what she said right after Abu Ghraib:  
   What took place at the Abu Ghraib prison does not represent America. Our nation is a compassionate country that believes in freedom. The U.S. government is deeply sorry for what has happened to some Abu Ghraib prisoners and people worldwide should be assured that President Bush is determined to learn the full truth of the prisoner reports in Iraq.  
   Those comments at that time were very important. They were the type of comments that I think pull us all together. It was a comment that reflected humanity. 
   Then we have this language that she writes a couple of months after she makes this beautiful speech in October saying she opposes this provision that says no prisoner shall be subject to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited by the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. She writes a letter opposing this section after she makes this beautiful speech. 
   When I asked her to explain it, she gives me reasons that just do not hold up, that it is duplicative, which it is not, that she really did not oppose it, which cannot possibly be true because we have her letter in writing where she did. 
   There is no doubt that Dr. Rice has the resume, the story, the intelligence, and the experience to be Secretary of State. She certainly is loyal to this President, we know that, and I think that is important. The President wants to have someone who is loyal. He should also want to have someone who will be independent such as Colin Powell was. 
   After 9 hours of grueling questions and answers before the committee, she proved her endurance for the job. In responding to me, she used a very clever tactic that we all learn in politics, which is to go after the questioner, why are you attacking me, and then do not answer the questions. It was OK that she did that. I did not mind that she did that. But she did not answer the questions. That is the point. 
   I believe the committee gave Dr. Rice the opportunity to speak candidly and set the record straight. It is not only my questions. Senator Biden asked her how many Iraqi security forces were trained, and without blinking an eye she said 120,000. And he said, wait a minute--and anyone who knows Senator Biden knows that he kind of roots for someone when they sit in the hot seat--let us really be candid here. He said: I went to Iraq and I was told by the military that there is nothing close to 120,000. He said he was told there were 4,000. She stuck by the 120,000. 
   Later, when others were asked in the administration, 
   such as Ambassador Negroponte, he would not put out a number but he sure did not say 120,000. 
   Everyone with a heart and a pulse knows it is not 120,000 trained troops, because as Senator Biden said at that hearing, if there are 120,000 trained Iraqi troops to protect the Iraqi people, why in God's name are we there in the numbers we are and keeping people there, who are leaving their families, for extra tours of duty? She would not budge. 
   I am troubled because we gave Dr. Rice every opportunity to speak candidly, set the record straight, and she just did not do that. 
   In her role as National Security Adviser, she was not responsible for coming to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or the House equivalent committee. Now she is going to be responsible for that. She could not have  a friendlier chairman than Senator Lugar in terms of being given every opportunity to work with our committee. I know Senator Biden and Senator Lugar work together just like brothers. This is a very bipartisan committee. We are going to see Dr. Rice there very often because she will be confirmed. I hope when she comes back before the committee that she will be more candid with the committee. 
   At this time I am judging her on her answers to these questions. She dodged so many of them and again resorted to half the story and even got herself in deeper water in some of her responses. So I cannot support this nomination. 
   The cost of the policy in Iraq, a policy that she embraced wholeheartedly, a policy that she did, in fact, bring to the American people and she led them to certain conclusions that turned out not to be true, whether it was the aluminum tubes, the ties to al-Qaida, whether it was her half argument on the Iran-Iraq war, whether it was her obvious contradictory statements on we never said he would have a nuclear weapon in a year one day and then the next year she said we did not say that, it is too hard to overlook these things. 
   I will close with the Martin Luther King quote, which I will not recite exactly but I do agree that our lives begin to end when we stop caring about things that matter. Accountability matters. Truth telling matters. The whole truth matters. Responsibility matters. The advice and consent role of the Senate is one that is really very important. I hope my colleagues on both sides will recognize that this Senate is at its best when we have some of these tough debates. 
   It is not as if we are having a vote to confirm a Cabinet position that will not have as much reach. It is not as if we are voting to confirm a position where the individual is brand new and does not have a record. This is a very important position in a time of war where the nominee had a record of making many statements to the American people. I believe that out of respect for the American people, out of respect for the Senate, out of respect for the Foreign Relations Committee, and out of respect to Condoleezza Rice herself, we needed to ask these questions. 
   Now that he is on the floor again, I would say to Senator Lugar what I said before, that he is such a fair chairman. All of us on the committee have such respect for him. I look forward to working with him on many issues. I think there will be many times where we will be voting the same way. We will not be today, but that is just one time. There will be many other occasions where we will be together. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, for being such a leader on this particular part of the bill which I have found extremely troubling from day one. 
   I note that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said we better not take the guest worker program out because, oh, my goodness, if we do take it out, there will be more illegal immigration. Well, maybe I am wrong on this--I do not think I am--but isn't a basic part of this bill to strengthen the border, the protections at the border? And isn't that part of what we are trying to do so we can stop the flow of illegal immigration--and having done that, allow the 11 to 12 million who are already here, who have clean records, who are willing to step forward, who are willing pay a fine, the chance at earned legalization? 
   And then there is another piece that deals with specific sectors of our economy, such as agriculture, where we know there are problems with the workforce. With respect to the agriculture industry, we set up a program called AgJOBS, which I credit Senator Feinstein for putting it in the bill. Senators CRAIG and KENNEDY, in a bipartisan effort, have supported this for many years, along with myself and others. 
   So we had, I thought, a very well balanced bill until we added a guest worker program. In other words, the bill strengthened the border in one section, created a pathway for the undocumented immigrants currently in the country, and then--addressed one area, agriculture, where we know we need these workers and set up a very carefully tailored program. The bill also made adjustments for highly skilled workers such as engineers, and fixed some of the visa programs. 
   So I thought that was a fairly balanced bill. Then what happened is, another piece was added, which is this really open-ended guest worker program which, in my opinion, will result in a permanent underclass of workers coming into our country. 
   What disturbs me is what the provision does to the American workforce. You hear: Oh, these are people who will do work that Americans won't do. Now, I would say that is a good argument when it comes to agriculture. But we have taken care of agriculture in the bill. We have the AgJOBS provision. And we have taken care of the 11 to 12 million undocumented workers currently in the U.S. and given them a path for continued employment. 
   So now, on top of it, we are looking at a program for 325,000 guest workers, each and every year, with an escalator of up to 20 percent added on to that. And what do you create now? A huge underclass of workers who will take jobs away from Americans. 
   Now, the American people are compassionate. They are understanding. I think most of them want us to do a comprehensive bill. Most of them do not like what is in the House bill, where if you lean over to help someone who may be having a heart attack on the ground in front of you and that person is undocumented, according to the House, you could go to jail. The American people do not like that. 
   But the American people also know we have not raised the minimum wage in almost 10 long years--which, by the way, I think we ought to darn well do on this bill--and that if you create another, virtually open-ended guest worker program, you are going to hurt the American people at the end of the day. 
   So you hear the colleagues on the other side saying: Oh, No. 1, if you don't have this additional guest worker program, then people will sneak across the border. No. We are strengthening the border. That is one of the underlying principles of the bill. So that is not accurate. 
   Now they say: Oh, if you don't do this, we will have jobs that are not filled. Now, what kind of jobs would guest workers do? Remember, we have already taken care of agriculture, so these guest workers are not for agricultural jobs. There are also separate provisions for the most highly educated immigrants, the various visa programs. So what would the guest workers do? 
   Here are some examples: construction, food preparation, manufacturing, and transportation jobs. Now, these are  fields where the vast majority of jobs are held by U.S. citizens and by legal workers. So it is incorrect to claim that the guest worker program, which has been kind of added on to what I think is a good bill, is targeted at jobs Americans will not do. These jobs are good jobs in good industries. 
   Now, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2004, there were 6.3 million workers employed in the U.S. construction sector, at an average wage of $18.21 an hour or $37,890 a year. Now, when I meet with my working people in California, they are fighting hard for these jobs. They want more of these jobs, not fewer of these jobs. The last thing they want is a guest worker program that is going to provide a big pool of workers who may make far less than this amount and take jobs away from my people. 
   I support the underlying bill except for this provision. I think this guest worker provision throws the whole thing out of whack. 
   For the bottom quarter of Americans, who are making an average wage of about $7 an hour, construction work is a dream job. They pray for those jobs. They stand in line hours for those jobs. But what are we doing if the Dorgan amendment does not succeed? We are going to take those jobs away because an employer is going to say: Gee, should I hire an $18-an-hour American worker or, let's see, a foreign worker in a guest worker program who I could pay less? You know what is going to happen. 
   Now, I think the real reason for a guest worker program is not what we hear about, oh, well, otherwise there will be more people sneaking across 
   the border, or we are short all these workers and we don't have workers for construction jobs, transportation jobs, food preparation jobs, manufacturing jobs, and the like; but it is really to set up, in my view, a permanent number of workers who are prepared to work at very cheap wages. That would be bad for the American workforce. 
   If we take this guest worker program out of this bill, we will have, my colleagues, a far better bill, a bill that we can all feel good about, a bill that does, in fact, reach out and say to undocumented workers who have worked here 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 3 years--and they have clean records and they have paid their taxes and they are willing to come forward and pay their fines, and the rest--we will have a good bill for them, we will have a good bill that strengthens the border, which I strongly support and have supported for years, we will have a balanced bill, that includes the AgJOBS piece. But if we do not take this out, we have a bill that I believe is going to hurt many American workers. 
   So I think the real reason this was put in was to have cheap labor, a cheap labor workforce. 
   Now, the median wage in Mexico is $1.83 an hour. The typical hourly wage in China is 33 cents. So I ask my colleagues, what does a minimum wage--even if it is not raised, and shame on us that it has not been raised in 9 long years, going on 10 years--what does a $5-an-hour wage look like? Heaven to those people. And we are going to sanction this fairly open-ended program that escalates up to 20 percent a year for what reason other than to provide a permanent cheap labor force? It is very worrisome to me. 
   There are some businesses that are wonderful, exemplary. There are others that would rather not look at their business as a family but just want to get the cheapest labor they can possibly get. So I cannot support the undermining of U.S. working conditions, and I cannot support a guest worker program that will decrease wages for low-income Americans. 
   For goodness' sake, I have stood on this floor 1 year--2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9--going on 10 years, fighting to increase the minimum wage. How could I possibly vote to keep in this bill a guest worker program when we have such an opportunity to strengthen this bill by stripping this out. It would leave us with a bill with tighter enforcement at the border, a humane, legal path for people who are living in the shadows--it will make us safer to get them out of the shadows, that is for sure--an AgJOBS program that is tailored to agriculture in a way that makes sense, and all those visa programs that address high skilled jobs? All that makes sense. 
   I commend the committee for giving us a chance craft such a bill. I would be proud to have as my legacy such a bill. But if we can remove this, what I call this guest worker add-on, if we can remove this, I think we will have a far stronger bill. 
   I commend my friend, Senator Dorgan. He is--I wanted to say he is dogged, and he is. He is dogged on behalf of working people. And I think he got this just right. I am very glad he has offered us this chance to improve this bill by pulling out the guest worker program. 
   With that, Mr. President, I yield back the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. As anyone watching the debate saw, I was in support of what Senator Dorgan was trying to do which was to strip the guest worker program from this bill, a bill that has a lot of good to it. I do support strengthening the border, and I do support giving 11 or 12 million hard-working people who have paid their dues, who will come forward and learn English and who will pay the fines, who have a clean record, a path to legality. I strongly support that, and I strongly support the AgJOBS provision of this bill. But I predict that this guest worker program, which the Senate has now ratified, is going to come back to haunt people because, as Senator Bingaman has shown us, the way this bill is structured, the workers will grow exponentially in this guest worker program to the point where, according to some estimates, we are talking about tens of millions of guest workers over the next 20 years. 
   What Senator Bingaman is trying to do is to put a cap on this, a real cap, not the phony cap that is in the bill that says it will escalate up to 20 percent every year. You figure out the math. It is kind of amazing. 
   What Senator Bingaman is doing is making this a better bill. I strongly support the cap he is proposing. I thank him for the opportunity to speak on behalf of his amendment. As usual, he has brought commonsense to the Senate. I hope the Senate will strongly support the Bingaman amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, with my friend and colleague from California, DIANNE FEINSTEIN, I introduce the ``California Ocean and Coastal Protection Act.'' This bill will permanently protect California's coast from the dangers of new offshore drilling. 
   In California, there is strong and enduring public support for the protection of our oceans and coastlines. Many years ago, my State decided that the potential benefits that might be derived from future offshore oil and gas development were not worth the risk of destroying our priceless coastal treasures. Regular chronic leakage associated with normal oil and gas operations, as well as catastrophic spills such as the horrific Santa Barbara rig blowout in 1969, irreparably contaminate our ocean, beaches, and wetlands. 
   The beauty of California's coast is so important that California passed legislation permanently prohibiting oil and gas exploration in State waters in 1994. This protection is limited, however, to California's territorial waters--only three nautical miles out from shore. 
   The Federal waters off the coast of California, which extend beyond State waters to 200 nautical miles out, are increasingly at risk of drilling. Despite years of bipartisan support for the moratoria on new offshore drilling in Federal waters, recent efforts are threatening our coasts. Some recent proposals would immediately lift the moratoria and allow for drilling within 20 miles off our coasts. Last year's energy bill included provisions to conduct  an inventory of oil and gas resources on the outer Continental Shelf (OCS). This inventory would be performed with seismic guns that could have devastating impacts on marine life. 
   Because of these threats, I am introducing legislation to provide permanent protection for California's coast from future drilling. It would also prohibit the harmful inventory of OCS resources from being conducted off California's coast. 
   The people of California agree that we must do everything we can to protect our coasts. This bill will finally provide the permanent protection against future drilling that Californians have demanded for a generation.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call this amendment the ``Gucci afterschool amendment'' because we are asking millionaires to give up one Gucci jacket or $2,000 out of their $114,000 tax cut they are going to get in 2007 so we can offer 716,000 additional children an afterschool program. 
   This amendment begins to fulfill the promise this President and this Congress made to our children. It will mean a big difference in every Senator's children's lives. In other words, I am looking at Senators all across this country. Every one of their States will see an increase of eligible children: in Alaska, 3,000 more children; in Florida, 33,000 more; in Indiana, 9,000 more; in Maine, 3,000 more--and it goes on--in New Hampshire, 3,000 more; in Ohio, 20,000 more; in Pennsylvania, 27,000 more; in Texas, 68,000 more.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose the proposed U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement. This agreement is not fair to American workers, plain and simple. 
   The theory behind free trade agreements is that two nations will agree to the free flow of goods as long as there is a relatively even playing field in terms of labor and environmental standards. 
   Without that even playing field, we face a worldwide ``race to the bottom,'' where the nations that pay their workers the least and offer them the fewest rights and protections, wins. 
   Sadly, the Bush administration has entered this particular race with gusto. 
   The Sultanate of Oman does not have much of a track record on worker's rights. There is no right to form independent unions or bargain collectively. The Omani constitution and labor laws do not prohibit the use of forced labor for public services and child labor is still permitted in law and practice. 
   The country of Oman has only 3 million people--and half a million of them are foreign ``guest workers,'' mainly from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and other Asian countries. And there have been numerous reports about how guest workers in that region have been exploited and underpaid, enabling their employers to turn out extremely low-cost products. 
   Unfortunately the trade agreement we are considering today offers no guarantees that Oman will not treat its ``guestworkers'' in the same way, and then be able to sell the products of their labor, duty free, to U.S. companies. 
   And we are asking American workers to compete against that? That's not free trade, defined as a mutually beneficial arrangement between two nations that raises living standards and general prosperity for the citizens of both countries. That's merely pitting American workers against the poorest, most desperate workers in the world, who work as foreign contract workers and have few legal or institutional protections. 
   I cannot support that approach to free trade. I proudly join with 400-plus labor, environmental, religious, human rights, consumer, business and family farm organizations, to oppose the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to speak to this nomination of this very controversial nominee who is opposed by both Senators from California, which is fairly extraordinary. I remember well a time in the not too distant past when even if one Senator from a State opposed a nominee from his or her State, that sank the nomination. Then they said it had to be both. 
   We have a situation where both Senators from California oppose this nominee. I can assure the Senator from Utah, if he opposed a nominee who came from his State, and his colleague did as well, I think I would give it a little more, shall we say, attention than he is. 
   The fact is, if you have watched this debate, you know by now that this nominee is way outside the mainstream. You can stand up here and say all you want that she is in the mainstream and within the mainstream. You can even say that she won election in California. What you are not saying is she came up for election about 11 months after she had served a 12-year appointment, and she had no opposition. Nobody ran against her. Most of  her controversial decisions occurred after that vote. 
   Anyone who knows anything about California politics knows that it is very rare that judges are made into an election issue. We usually approve our judges. It is very different than what is being presented here, that everyone went out and said: Oh, hurrah, Janice Rogers Brown is running. This is not the case at all. We have Senator Hatch coming up and saying this woman is well within the mainstream and all the rest of it, but the two Senators from California are saying: Watch out. Because no statement could be further from the truth. 
   I have spoken on this nomination and on the broader issue several times. Sometimes you ask yourself, is it worth just one more time? I would say, in answering my own question, to me it is worth it just one more time because the issues surrounding these nominations we are addressing these next days will bring home to the American people why it was that we had all this fuss over 10 judges the Democrats blocked. These are 10 judges put forward by President Bush who were all extraordinary cases, outside the mainstream, whether dealing with employment rights or the environment or civil rights or human rights--any kind of rights you can think about: privacy rights, the right to make sure our kids are protected and our criminals are punished. 
   In these 10 cases, we found many examples where our people were left in the lurch because of decisions made by these judges. In some cases, these judges, fortunately, were in the minority. In the case of Janice Rogers Brown, she was in the minority many times because she is so out of the mainstream that not even her five Republican colleagues could join her in many of her dissents. 
   But this number, 208 to 10, reflects where we were when the Republicans threw a fit and the White House threw a fit and said: We want every one of our judges passed. We don't want to lose even 5 percent of our judges. They got 95 percent. They were not happy--208 to 10, and they threatened to change a system that has been in place well before the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' came out. For more than 200 years, the Senate has had the right to unlimited debate that can only be shut off by a supermajority. We have had that in place for a very long time. 
   The Republicans did not like it. They only got 95 percent of their judges and, by God, they wanted 100 percent. It reminds me of my kids when they were little, and probably I was that way when I was little. ``I want it all. I want everything. I don't want to give up a thing.'' That is not the way the Senate works. It is not the way the country works. 
   If you read what the Founders had in mind for our Nation, it was protecting minority rights. So when an appointment such as this, which is a lifetime appointment--at very high pay, by the way, and very good retirement--that there would be a check and balance against this nominee, so only those who deserve to be on the bench, who show that they had judicial temperament, who were qualified--underscore that, very important--and who were in the mainstream, will take their seats. So we had a crisis that, fortunately, I am very pleased to say, was resolved by some Republicans and Democrats who got together and stood up to the Republican leadership and said: Wrong. We are not going to do this. We are not going to see a packing of the courts. We are going to preserve the filibuster. 
   But what happened was three very controversial judges got past that filibuster. That was the deal that was cut, that Priscilla Owen, that Pryor, and here Janice Rogers Brown would be guaranteed their cloture vote, and then we will now be voting on them. It will take 51 votes to stop Janice Rogers Brown. I hope we can get that. 
   Senator Hatch said he hopes every single person in the 
   Senate will vote for Janice Rogers Brown. I predict, if she gets confirmed, it will be by the fewest number of votes we have seen around here, probably, in many years. I think so. 
   Let me talk about the issue of qualifications because this is something I did not discuss with my colleagues up until now. On April 26, 1996, the Los Angeles Times wrote about an evaluation report that was written about Judge Janice Rogers Brown. This is what the Times reported:  
   Bar evaluators received complaints that Brown was insensitive to established legal precedent ..... lacked compassion and intellectual tolerance for opposing views, misunderstood legal standards and was slow to produce opinions.  
   Can you imagine? This is the person who everyone who spoke on the other side today has said is so great, everyone who spoke on the other side said is so wonderful? This is the person they all said deserves to be promoted? Let's read it again because it is important. This woman is going to the circuit court of appeals in Washington. ``Bar evaluators''--these are the people who are the experts--``received complaints that Brown was insensitive to established legal precedent ..... lacked compassion''--and we are going to show that--``and intellectual tolerance for opposing views. .....'' In other words, intolerant to opposing views. Can you imagine a judge who is intolerant to opposing views? How can that judge be independent? How can that judge be fair if, going in, they are intolerant to certain views? And they said she ``misunderstood legal standards.'' That is a condemnation for someone who is going to be judging. ``And she was slow to produce opinions.'' We all know that we would like to have justice be swiftly delivered. Justice delayed is justice denied. She was slow to produce opinions. 
   The LA Times goes on:  
   She does not possess the minimum qualifications necessary for appointment to the highest court in the State,  
   That is my State, the California Supreme Court.  
   ..... the bar commission that reviews judicial nominees told Governor Pete Wilson in a confidential report.  
   Janice Rogers Brown  
   ..... does not possess the minimum qualifications necessary for appointment to the highest court in the State, the bar commission that reviews judicial nominees told Governor Pete Wilson in a confidential report.  
   This is the nominee Senator Hatch says he hopes everybody votes for. Now she is moving over to an area where she hasn't really practiced before, to the Federal bench. 
   Yesterday, I was at a press conference with some fantastic women lawyers, including Eleanor Holmes Norton, who you know, I think, is the delegate to the House of Representatives from DC, and also Elaine Jones. They went through, chapter and verse, her decisions, her writings, her minority views. They agreed this is a terrible appointment. What is interesting is these are African-American women speaking about an African-American woman. This is not easy to do. It is not easy for a female Senator to say this is a terrible appointment. 
   This nominee's personal story is remarkable. There are a lot of remarkable stories in America. We are all so proud of our country, that it gives people opportunity. But what I am fearful about is what she is going to do to those who want to grab that dream. Her attitude toward what the government can and cannot do, her attitude about what is permissible in a workplace, is shocking. Her attitude toward senior citizens, her attitude toward children, her attitude toward rape victims, all of this is very frightening, to think this woman, with a great personal story, is going to bring those kinds of values and this kind of record to the court that many consider to be second in importance to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. 
   There is no question that this nominee is way out of the mainstream. This is one of her famous quotes. You listen to these words. These are not the words of Senator Barbara Boxer or Senator Dianne Feinstein or Senator Patrick Leahy or Senator Harry Reid or any other Senator who is opposing this nominee; these are the words of the nominee:  
   Where government moves in, community retreats, civil society disintegrates, and our ability to control our own destiny atrophies. The result is: Families under siege; war in the streets; unapologetic expropriation of property; the precipitous decline of the rule of law; the rapid rise of corruption; the loss of civility and the triumph of deceit. The result is a debased, debauched culture which finds moral depravity entertaining and virtue contemptible.  
   I don't know what country she grew up in. I really don't know how she got her views of America because clearly she has been critical of the government in her writings, going back to the 1930s. So, presumably, because she has been in the minority view on all the things  she says and does, she has to be miserable about the state of America. She thinks our families are under siege, that there is war in the streets, that people are getting their property taken away from them, that there is a decline in the rule of law. I guess she doesn't know we are doing much better controlling crime. Who does she think is going to control crime if not government? Does she think we should have a private police force? 
   When government moves in, everything is terrible. Does that mean when we build a highway things get worse, or do they get better? Does that mean if we fund a transit system things get worse, or they get better? Does that mean when we fix a pothole or pass a law that you have to wear a seatbelt that things get worse, or things get better? 
   She is an idealogue because the answer is sometimes government does good things, and sometimes we don't. Sometimes we do things we should not do, and sometimes we don't do enough. But there is no way you can say when government moves in, deceit triumphs and we have a debauched culture and virtue is contemptible. Is she that critical of this country? Is she that down on this country? Is she that negative about the greatest country in the world? The answer is, she is. 
   Let's look at some of the other things she said. 
   When we had the New Deal, this country was in the middle of a terrible depression, and the Congress and the President passed some overdue legislation such as the minimum wage because people were starving to death. They said it was important to have a 40-hour workweek because people were being worked to death. Social Security was instituted at that time. She calls this ``the triumph of our own Socialist revolution.'' 
   I am assuming, therefore, she thinks we should go back to the days when we did not have Social Security. That is interesting because there are other people who feel that way around here. So they happily vote for Janice Rogers Brown. Does she think we should go back to the day when children worked in the workplace? Child labor laws were passed around that time. Does she think a boss can tell you, you have to work 100 hours? I guess she does because it is socialism. 
   And then her famous quote about senior citizens. This is a woman who this President wants to send to the second highest court in the land. Her view of senior citizens is extraordinary: She called senior citizens ``cannibals.'' I want everyone to think of their grandma right now. Does anyone think of their grandma as a militant? Does anyone think of their grandma as stealing from you? Or, rather, that your grandma thinks much more about you than she does about herself? I can assure you that is what we think of our grandmas. They will do anything for us, for their grandchildren. But not Janice Rogers Brown. She accuses senior citizens of ``blithely cannibalizing their grandchildren because they have a right to get as much `free stuff' as the political system permits them to extract.'' 
   What a view of our senior citizens. The greatest generation; the generation that fought in World War II. And now, getting to be the generation that fought Vietnam, one of the toughest wars because it was so controversial, and the suffering that guess on. These are the folks that are now the grandparents and the senior citizens. They are getting as much ``free stuff.'' Why? Because they served in the military and they get veterans' benefits, veterans' health care, and prescription drugs if they are sick. I resent Janice Rogers Brown's statements. I resent that statement on behalf of every senior citizen in this country. You can put lipstick on it, you can put nail polish on it, it is still ugly. 
   She calls government ``the drug of choice.'' She even goes after rugged midwestern farmers. She says they are looking for big government. 
   Who does she know--a rugged midwestern farmer who is looking for the Government to support them? And ``militant senior citizen.'' Every time I say that I think of grandmothers in Army uniforms marching down the street. These are visions so ridiculous that they have no place being brought into this D.C. Court of Appeals. At the end of the day, that means there is deep hostility toward our senior citizens, toward our workers, toward our farmers, toward our people. 
   Janice Rogers Brown is way outside the mainstream to the extreme. 
   I hope the American people understand why we held her up for so long. The only reason she is getting the up-or-down vote today is she is part of the deal to preserve the filibuster for future out-of-the-mainstream folks. We were on the verge of losing that. 
   She argued that e-mail messages sent by a former employee to coworkers criticizing a company's employment practices were not protected by the first amendment, but she supported corporate speech. That was in Intel v. Hamidi. 
   She argued that a city's rent control ordinance was unconstitutional and a result of the ``revolution of 1937.'' The woman is stuck in the past. She keeps going back to the New Deal, to 1937. Get over it. The things that worked well, we have continued--such as Social Security, minimum wage, or the FDIC, where we protect your deposits. Get over it. The American people demand those minimum protections. 
   But not Janice Rogers Brown. She does not demand it. She argues that it was a revolution that the New Deal began. She opposed it and says it is all about takings and it is all wrong. 
   Here is an interesting fact. Janice Rogers Brown is on a court with six Republicans and one Democrat. People say, it is California, it is California, everyone there is a liberal Democrat. Wrong. I would not be here if it were not for Republican, Independent voters, and Democratic voters. Here is the deal: She stood alone on a court of six Republicans and one Democrat 31 times. Think about it. You are a judge. You are a Republican. You have five Republican colleagues and one Democratic colleague. Yet 31 times you disagreed with those five Republicans and that one Democrat. 
   Who could actually stand up here, look the American people in the eye, and say she is a mainstream judge? That is just not true, based on the facts. Members can say whatever they want on the Senate floor, and I would die for 
   a Members' right to free speech. You can put lipstick on it, nail polish, and dress it up, but the facts are the facts: She stood alone 31 times on a court of six Republicans and one Democrat. 
   Maybe it goes back to what the bar said about her, when she was put up for her position, that she was unqualified, that she did not understand legal precedent. Maybe that explains why she stands alone, she does not know what she is doing. Maybe she does not understand it. Maybe she does not get it; otherwise, why would she find herself alone so many times? 
   Let's go back to what has been said when she was appointed by Pete Wilson. They received complaints that Brown was ``insensitive to established legal precedent.'' In a court of appeals, that is a key fact. You have to understand what the law is, what has come before. She ``lacked compassion and intellectual tolerance for opposing views, misunderstood legal standard and was slow to produce opinions.'' 
   Maybe she just couldn't follow the reasoning of her colleagues because she did not understand the legal precedence, or maybe they were moving too fast for her. Or, maybe she chose just not to follow it because she lacked compassion, and she has no intellectual tolerance for opposing views, even if it is legal precedent. 
   Let's see what else they said:  
   She does not possess the minimum qualifications necessary for appointment to the highest court in the State [that is the California State court] the bar commission that reviews judicial nominees told Gov. Pete Wilson in a confidential report.  
   This was printed in the ``Los Angeles Times'' April 26, 1996. 
   One would think that the President's men who came up with this idea would have vetted this person. Why did we stop her from getting a vote? Simply because we knew the facts. If she wasn't qualified for the California Supreme Court, how does she now get to be qualified for this position? It makes no sense. 
   We will go back to some of the times she stood alone. This case is rather remarkable. We have Janice Rogers Brown, a female. A case comes before her of a woman who was 60 years old. She was a superstar working in a hospital, Huntington Memorial Hospital.  She was fired from her job based on age discrimination. Janice Rogers Brown said:  
    ..... discrimination based on age does not mark its victims with a stigma of inferiority and second class citizenship.  
   I ask the average American: A 60-year-old employee is perky, who is sharp, who is wise, who is experienced, who has gotten stellar reviews, who does better than almost anyone else, but she is fired because someone in management said, 60, you are out. So she is out of a job. And this woman had a lot of pride in her work. Maybe it was her whole life, maybe she was so devoted. We know people like that. Janice Rogers Brown makes a statement that ``discrimination based on age does not mark its victims with a stigma of inferiority and second class citizenship.'' 
   Yesterday in the press conference where I was with a lot of minority women lawyers, one of them, Elaine Jones, made an important point about this case. She said it is fine for Janice Rogers Brown to think that discrimination based on 
   age does not mark its victim with a stigma of inferiority and second class citizenship. If she feels that way, she should run for public office, run for the Senate, go to the House and change the laws we have written which say, in fact, it is a stigma to be the victim of age discrimination. This is hurtful, and it does confer second-class citizenship on the individual. 
   Her position is her own opinion. Everyone has a right to his or her own opinion. I don't have a problem with that. I don't agree with her. I think it is mean. I think it is nasty. I think it hurts our people. But she has a right to think that if she wants. What she does not have a right to do as a judge is to say that the law we passed simply does not exist. That is why she is so out of the mainstream. We have found that age discrimination brings with it a stigma of inferiority and second-class citizenship. We have said it is illegal. It is not legal. Her position is contrary to State and Federal law and puts her way outside the mainstream. 
   And now a look at some of the others. She is the only member of the court to vote to overturn the conviction of the rapist of a 17-year-old girl because she felt the victim gave mixed messages to the rapist. 
   Maybe my colleagues on the other side want to send someone to this very important court that stands with a rapist against a victim. I wouldn't think so. If one reads details of the case, members will be shocked by the details. The young woman already was raped once. This was a second rape. The first man pleaded guilty. He claimed innocence, but she was the only member of the court to say this young woman did not have a right to see this rapist confined to prison. 
   It is shocking to me that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle think this woman is in the mainstream. Is it in the mainstream of America to side with a rapist over a 17-year-old girl? Is it in the mainstream of America to side with an employer who fires you because you turn 60? It is totally against the State and Federal law. 
   She was the only member of the court to oppose an effort to stop the sale of cigarettes to children. That case was Stop Youth Addiction v. Lucky Stores. There is a reason there is an organization called Stop Youth Addiction--because we all know that tobacco is so addictive. When you start young, it is very hard to kick the habit. I am sure everyone in this Chamber who has ever smoked knows how hard it is to kick the habit. The younger you start, the more hooked you get. 
   Therefore, parents and others who are advocates are trying to make sure they cannot go into the store and purchase cigarettes at an underage level. She was the only member of the court to oppose the effort we had going on to ensure that kids do not buy cigarettes. 
   Is that mainstream thought, to go up against parents and families and say it is fine for a retail store to go ahead and sell cigarettes to a kid--your kid, my kid, my grandson? That is not mainstream. It is out of the mainstream. 
   This woman is out of the mainstream. That is why the Democrats have stopped her, until today. We did use the filibuster on her. We were glad to use the filibuster on her. If it did not happen that we had this deal, we would still be using the filibuster on her, to protect the people of the United States of America from her kind of values which stand with a rapist, which stand with the tobacco companies, which stand with those who discriminate. 
   She can explain in any way she wants. We know the results of her thinking. She could come up with a fancy explanation to tell this young 17-year-old woman, but look her in the eye and say: Well, your rapist has to get out because you didn't say it exactly the right way--when every other member of the court sided with this 17-year-old girl. 
   I am shocked my colleagues are supporting this nominee. And this issue is not going to go away. These decisions are not going to go away. There are going to be writings about these decisions. There is going to be discussion about them. People will be held accountable for their votes here. They should be, one way or the other. 
   If people in my home State are going to write and say, Why are you speaking out against someone from California, a woman who is a sharecropper's daughter, I am going to say, That is a good question, and let me tell you why. She is out of the mainstream to the extreme, and she is hurting our people. It is pretty simple for me. 
   She is bad on discrimination. She is the only member of the court to find that a State fair housing commission could not award certain damages to housing discrimination victims. And how about this? An African-American policewoman needed to rent a place and knocked on a door and had the door slammed in her face--more than once, again and again. She sued for discrimination. Every single member of that court, the highest court in California, ruled in favor of this policewoman--except Janice Rogers Brown. Oh, no. Oh, no. She said: You do not deserve any damages. You do not deserve any award for what you went through. Too bad. 
   Now, she may not have written it like that in her statement, but at the end of the day she had to look in this woman's eyes, this policewoman's, and say: Got the door slammed in your face three times? Too bad. That is the bottom line with how she ruled. She might as well have said that. And she stood alone. Is that American values? Is that mainstream America, that someone would stand on the side of someone who slammed the door in the face of someone simply because they did not like their appearance, they did not look like them? Seriously, folks, this is pretty basic American values 101. 
   She is the only member of the court to find that a disabled worker who was the victim of employment discrimination did not have the right to raise past instances of discrimination that had occurred. So here is someone who is saying they were victimized in an employment situation because they were disabled, they wanted to be able to tell about the series of events that led up to this particular lawsuit, how many times this had happened--she had MS and these discriminatory acts had taken place over many years--and Janice Rogers Brown stood alone and said she did not have the right to raise the past instances of discrimination. 
   Is that an American value, to tell someone who has multiple sclerosis, who has been discriminated against for years: Well, we are not interested; we are not interested in hearing about the past; just stick to this one case? 
   I do not think, if my colleagues really took the time and the energy and the effort to do the kind of work my great staff has done on this--and I have to say, I heard Senator Hatch say, well, all this comes from--what did he say?--liberal groups writing these things. This is painstakingly difficult work done by my staff. And they went through it because I said: Did she ever stand alone--because I knew her reputation is so out of the mainstream--did she ever stand alone? And they came back to me with this: She stood alone on the side of a rapist. She stood alone on the side of people who would discriminate. She stood alone on the side of tobacco companies against families. That is how I look at it. 
   She said a manager could use racial slurs against his Latino employees. Can you imagine coming to work every day and having to put up with a slur about yourself, about your ethnicity, about your religion, about your disability? There has to be some value  placed on human dignity. Well, you do not get it when you look at the writings of Janice Rogers Brown. You do not get it when you look at the way she comes down on a lot of these cases. 
   She was the only member of the court who voted to strike down a State antidiscrimination law that provided a 
   contraceptive drug benefit to women. There is a very important law in my State that says if a woman wants to get contraceptives through her insurance, she should be allowed to. We talk around here a lot about the right to choose and all of that. All of us, I would hope, would come together in saying we do not want to see so many abortions. That is right. We want to make sure we reduce the number of abortions. Well, the way you do that is through contraception. 
   There was a time and place when contraception use was illegal in this country, until there was a case in the Supreme Court that was actually memorialized yesterday, the Griswold case, which said: No. It is legal. Well, if contraception is legal, why on Earth would we discriminate against people who try to use their health insurance to get it, their drug benefit to get it? 
   So this case comes before the California Supreme Court, and every member of the court--five Republicans and one Democrat--except her, except Janice Rogers Brown, says that is an appropriate law. So, again, we have someone out of the mainstream. If she is so out of the mainstream on contraception, imagine where she will be on the right to privacy, if she gets into that issue. 
   She is the only member of the court to find that a jury should not hear expert testimony in a domestic violence case about ``battered women's syndrome.'' Now, this one really touches my heart because, fortunately, many years ago, Senator Joe Biden phoned me when I was a House Member, and he said that he had written a bill called the Violence Against Women Act. We knew women were being battered and women were being raped. The violence against women was growing, and yet there was no Federal response. We have made tremendous progress in this area. We still have a long way to go. 
   Mr. President, I have been asked a question. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. BOXER. As we learned more about stopping violence against women, we found out something very ugly, which is sometimes women are in such a desperate circumstance, after being battered for so long, that they lose their center and their balance and they fight back. Sometimes you will have a case that comes before a court, and in defending a woman they want to bring in an expert to talk about battered women syndrome--why is it that a woman, who is otherwise peaceful, otherwise decent, with no criminal record, no criminal history, would suddenly break out and do violence to another. 
   If you do not understand battered women syndrome, it makes it difficult. Janice Rogers Brown was the only member of the court to say a jury should not hear expert testimony in a domestic violence case about ``battered women's syndrome''--the only one. How is that in the mainstream of thinking? How is that in the mainstream of American values? How is that going to help us learn more about why people would act in a certain way? It does not say how a jury has to find. They just wanted to have this testimony. All of her colleagues found it would be perfectly appropriate. Not Janice Rogers Brown--out of the mainstream, in the extreme, standing alone time after time. 
   Janice Rogers Brown, the only member of the court who voted to bar an employee from suing for sexual harassment because she had signed a standard workers' compensation release form. She was the only member of the court who said: You do not have the right to sue if you have been sexually harassed because you have already signed a workers' comp release form. They are two different things. Yet for her, no, it was one and the same, and she stood alone in this case as well. 
   She was the only member of the court to find nothing improper about requiring a criminal defendant to wear a 50,000 volt stun belt while testifying. I think we discussed the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court recently made a judgment on this, that it is very important, in order to have a fair trial--and in America that is what we believe in. 
   Now, I, myself, am very tough on a criminal. I would do the worst of the worst to someone convicted of a heinous crime because I believe people give up their right to be among us if they commit a heinous crime. So I am very tough. At the same time, I understand you do not want to do something that would prejudice a case. When you bring someone into court, before they have been found guilty of anything, and they are wearing a 50,000 volt stun belt, it may give a message to the jury. And that may just result in an overturning of a conviction later on. 
   So the California Supreme Court found, except for Janice Rogers Brown, it was a mistake. She stood alone. 
   So let me finish up in this way. It is really an extraordinary nomination, this particular nomination. When the Democrats stood tall against this nominee, there were reasons. There were reasons we stood tall against 10 nominees. We allowed 208 to move forward, but we stood against 10. We stood against 10 and said: Do you know what. We are going to follow historic precedent. If we believe these nominees are out of the mainstream, we are going to stand and be counted. 
   It is not pleasant. It is not nice. It is not enjoyable. It is not something anyone looks forward to. 
   It is unusual to do it, and we did it 10 times. We gave this President a 95-percent ``yes'' record of judge confirmations, but he is not a happy camper unless he gets 100 percent. If I got 95 percent of the vote, I would be soaring high. If I got 95 percent of my bills passed through here, I would be soaring high. I would be so happy if my kids listened to me 95 percent of the time. I would be smiling. I would say: Yes, I think you are wrong on that 5 percent, but I feel good about it. 
   Not this President; he wants 100 percent. It is called the arrogance of power. It is called one-party rule. I think the American people want to be governed, not ruled. We had a King George once. It didn't work out very well. We like President George better than King George. But President George, as every President, whether it was Bill or Harry or you name it--some day it will be a woman, I can hope--every President who reads the Constitution knows there is an advice and consent clause. That means when you put people up for these lifetime appointments, the Senate has an important role to play. And instead of being annoyed about it, instead of being bothered about it, instead of feeling it is cramping your style, you should use your power, your effectiveness, your political capital, your charm, use whatever you have to come over to the Senate, to sit down with Senators, to say: Look, I am thinking of putting up Mr. X or Mrs. X. What do you think? 
   It is frustrating because early in the Bush Presidency, Alberto Gonzales, who was the White House counsel, came over and he did say to me--because I was against a Ninth Circuit Court nominee--do you have any good ideas for who else you might support? I did. I talked to my people, to my Republican supporters. We came in. We had six terrific Republican names. We sent them. Nothing. So they asked, but they never acted. Some of these people were quite conservative. I think they would have been pleased. But this seems to be an administration that wants 100 percent of what they want. They don't want the shared responsibility of governing. Either they don't want or they don't understand or they don't like the balance of powers, which is such a centerpiece of our Government. 
   We see it on the Bolton nomination as well. That is not for a judgeship. That is a nomination for U.N. ambassador. But, again, if we could just talk to each other, we could come up with someone who would be terrific, instead of having these standoffs, which are difficult. They are not pleasant. We are not getting a lot of work done because of how much time we are talking about Janice Rogers Brown, because many of us believe she is so out of the mainstream, we can't let it go. That is why  I so respect the moderates who came up with the agreement because part of that agreement said in the future the President should talk to us more, especially about Supreme Court nominees. 
   We are at a place and time where we have proven one point, that when we stood up against these 10 judges and allowed 208 to go through, it wasn't arbitrary or capricious or nasty or personal. It was because these people are out of the mainstream. I well remember when George Bush was declared the winner in 2000, he came right out and said: I am going to govern from the middle. 
   Here is where we are: George Will, `` `Extraordinary' Rhetoric.'' George Will calls Janice Rogers Brown out of the mainstream. George Will is very rightwing and he calls her out of the mainstream. He says it is a fact that she is out of the mainstream. 
   The Mercury News says:  
   As an appellate judge who would hear the bulk of challenges to Federal laws coming out of Washington, Janice Rogers Brown's appointment would be disastrous. She'd be likely to strike down critical environmental, labor laws and antidiscrimination protections. Brown, though, has infused her legal opinions with her ideology, ignoring higher court rulings that should temper her judgment.  
   That was the from San Jose Mercury News, a very mainstream newspaper in Silicon Valley. 
   From the Sacramento Bee that sits in the heart of the capital of California:  
   The minority in the Senate certainly is justified in filibustering a lifetime appointment of Brown. 
    ..... The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is the last place we need a judge who would impose 19th century economic theory on the Constitution and 21st century problems. 
   The issue isn't Brown's qualifications; it's her judicial philosophy.  
   I see my friend from Colorado is here. I will stop now and thank him for the work he did on that compromise on the filibuster. I was not a happy person that Janice Rogers Brown was in the group, but our side had to give up something. I have spent days expressing why I hope there will be a strong vote against her. She is out of the mainstream. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the balance of my time to Senator Salazar.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries Boundary Modification and Protection Act. I am joined in this effort by Senator FEINSTEIN and Representative LYNN WOOLSEY who has introduced the companion bill in the other body. 
   The Gulf of the Farallones and the adjacent Cordell Bank are rich with wildlife and are visually spectacular. They are one of California's--indeed America's--great natural treasures. 
   Thirty-three marine mammal species use this area. Over half of these are threatened or endangered. The sanctuaries also contain one of the largest  populations of blue and humpback whales in the world. Every summer, many grey whales dwell in the boundaries and neighboring waters of the sanctuaries. In addition, birds rely on the rich waters and surrounding land for nesting, feeding, and rearing of their young. 
   As effective as the current boundaries are in protecting this wildlife, new risks and a better understanding of the ecosystem necessitate extending the existing boundaries. 
   My legislation would expand the boundaries of the two existing national marine sanctuaries to protect the entire Sonoma Coast. By expanding the boundaries of both the Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries, the bill will protect the Russian and Gualala River estuaries and the nutrient-rich Bodega Canyon from offshore oil drilling and pollution. 
   Expanding these marine sanctuaries will help to ensure that they remain the treasures they are. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of this long overdue legislation to expand stem cell research. 
   When this issue first came up with President Bush in 2001, he had a choice between helping scientists conduct lifesaving research or putting politics before science. To the detriment of the millions of Americans suffering from diseases and conditions for which there is no cure, the President chose politics and decided that Federal funds could only be used for research on existing stem cell lines. 
   At the time, there were 78 existing stem cell lines--only 22 of which were usable. Scientists agreed that this was nowhere near enough to fulfill the promise that stem cell research provides. To make matters worse, scientists at the University of California San Diego and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla conducted an extensive study showing that even those lines are contaminated by mouse feeder cells--and unsuitable for human therapies. So the President's policy--painted as a compromise at the time--left scientists with little to no chance to advance their research. 
   At least 10 countries have made significant financial commitments to stem cell research. Our commitment is less than one quarter of Australia's. Our country's failure to lead on this is having significant consequences. Here is one example: 
   After the President's announcement in 2001, Roger Pedersen, one of the world's leading stem cell researchers, announced that he was leaving his faculty position at the University of California San Francisco for one at the University of Cambridge. He saw a promising future for stem cell research in the United Kingdom, yet saw none in the United States. 
   We need to change this. 
   I am proud to say that California recognized that our Federal policy was unacceptable. The State has enacted the Nation's first law to permit research involving human embryonic and adult stem cells while facilitating the voluntary donation of embryos for stem cell research. Now how did this happen in California? It started with one man and one family. 
   Roman Reed was 19 years old when he broke his neck in a college football game and became paralyzed. Roman's  parents led a campaign in 2002 to pass legislation to invest in spinal cord injury research. 
   Then, in November 2004, Californians passed Proposition 71, which provides $3 billion in State funding over 10 years for embryonic stem cell research. Unfortunately for Roman and his family, legal challenges have stalled these funds, and with them, stalled their hope for a brighter future. 
   More States are considering their own initiatives, but these State efforts simply can't supplant the resources and expertise that would result from research supported by this administration and the National Institute of Health. 
   Today, after years of struggling to pass this legislation, we have an opportunity to offer hope to thousands of Americans and put America back on the cutting edge of science. We know we can make a difference when we give our scientists the tools and support to do their work. 
   Because of our national commitment to scientific achievement and through NIH-supported research, death rates for heart disease and sudden infant death syndrome have been nearly cut in half in the past several years. The number of AIDS-related deaths fell 70 percent between 1995 and 2001. HIV/AIDS has become a disease that more people live with and fewer die from. And as a result of critical research at the National Cancer Institute at NIH, the survival rate for children with cancer rose by 80 percent in the 1990s. 
   The current Federal policy has been a roadblock to progress. This bill will put us back on the right track. Some in this body have been telling the American public that stem cell research is morally wrong. But we have taken every step to address their concerns in this bill. 
   This legislation would only allow Federal funding of research on stem cell lines derived from excess fertilized embryos that were never actually used in couples' in vitro fertilization processes. Right now, these embryos are being discarded, and we are losing hundreds or even thousands of valuable new stem cell lines. 
   I believe it is wrong to have those embryonic stem cell lines go to waste when we could instead offer hope to Americans suffering from devastating medical conditions. We have a moral imperative to try to relieve their pain. 
   That is why we have seen a broad coalition of people across political lines that support this research. One example is former First Lady Nancy Reagan. She took a stand that was based on compassion and not politics. For many years, she cared for President Reagan. She inspired millions of Americans with her quiet courage and dignity. She knows that this research holds the best hope for the 4.5 million people who, like her late husband, suffer from Alzheimer's. She knows that supporting stem cell research would save many lives. 
   Our beloved Christopher Reeve--who we all know was paralyzed from a riding accident--supported and actively campaigned for this research because he knew that those 250,000 to 400,000 people with spinal cord injuries potentially could be treated. 
   How many of us have ever seen a colleague, friend, or family member suffering from a terrible disease like Parkinson's? Where the sufferers and their families struggle with debilitating physical deterioration, ever-changing medications with terrible side effects and the knowledge that the patient's condition will continue to decline--often fatally? 
   How many of us have met with constituents and patient advocate groups--like the ALS Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society--that share their stories of courage and great hope for the passage of this legislation? Stem cell research has the potential for finding cures to diseases like Parkinson's, ALS, diabetes, and cancer, and has the great potential to reduce suffering. We should fulfill that potential and pass this important legislation now. 
   I hope that Senators support H.R. 810 because we can change the current policy and open the door to major advances in medical science through stem cell research. 
   President Bush has said that he will veto this legislation if it reaches his desk. I ask him to reconsider this unwise decision. The lives of millions of Americans are in his hands.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing ``the Eastern Sierra Rural Heritage and Economic Enhancement Act,'' a bill that will provide protection for thousands of some of the most pristine, wild, and beautiful acres in California. I am glad to be joined in this effort by my colleague, Senator FEINSTEIN. Representative MCKEON, whose congressional districts contains these special lands, introduced companion legislation today in the House of Representatives.  
   My bill will protect three very special California treasures in the Eastern Sierra. It makes considerable additions to existing Hoover Wilderness areas, which border on Yosemite National Park. These additions will protect the stunning High Sierra landscape of 11,000 foot snow-capped peaks and valleys, lush meadows and deep forests that people around the world associate with the Eastern Sierra. 
   These areas are also home to an abundance of wildlife, including black bear, mountain lion, mule deer, waterfowl, and bald eagles. 
   This land provides more than just visual beauty, however--it is also a recreational paradise. Year after year, hikers enjoy the approximately nine miles of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail that runs through this wilderness, and anglers enjoy the clear lakes and streams that support a number of species of wild trout. The bill will also protect areas adjacent to the Emigrant Wilderness area, including another two miles of the Pacific Crest Trail. 
   My legislation will also designate about 24 miles of the Amargosa River as a Wild and Scenic River. As the only river flowing into Death Valley, the Amargosa is an ecologically-important river in a dry desert area. Birds--and birdwatchers--abound in this area, both coming from far and wide to enjoy the river area. 
   In short, these areas are not just California's natural treasures--they are America's natural treasures. And that is why they deserve the highest level of protection possible. That is what this bill does. 
   I was proud to include most of these lands in my California Wild Heritage Act that I reintroduced last month. And I look forward to working with Senator FEINSTEIN and Representative MCKEON, and all my colleagues, to protect these special places forever.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Freedom of Choice Act. When the Supreme Court issued its landmark Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, it made clear that our Constitutional right to privacy grants women the freedom to choose whether to begin, prevent, or continue a pregnancy. 
   The purpose of this bill is very simple: It ensures that the guarantees of Roe v. Wade will be there for every generation of women. 
   We know what Roe has meant for women these past 33 years. It has allowed them to make their most personal and difficult reproductive decisions in consultation with loved ones and health care providers. It has given them the dignity to plan their own families and the ability to participate fully in the economic and social life of our country. And, most important, it has preserved health and saved lives. 
   Many of us are old enough to remember what it was like in the days before Roe. More than a million women a year were forced to seek illegal abortions, pushed into the back alleys where they risked infection, hemorrhage, disfiguration, and death. Some estimate that thousands of women died every year because of illegal abortions before Roe. 
   When the Senate debated the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Alito, women wrote to me with their own heart-breaking stories. For one woman, the year was 1956. She was only four when her mother died of an illegal abortion performed with a coat hanger. Too scared to ask for help, her mother bled to death at work. 
   Another woman wrote to me about how hard her mother and father struggled during the depression, how they worked day and night to make ends meet and support their two children. When her mother found out she was pregnant again, she had health problems, and she knew she couldn't take care of another child. She made the very difficult decision to get an illegal abortion. The procedure left her bleeding for weeks, and she almost died. 
   Mr. President, the American people do not want us to go back to those dark days. In a recent CNN poll, 66 percent said they do not want Roe overturned. Yet there is a dangerous movement afoot to overrule Roe and, in the meantime, to severely undermine its promises. 
   Make no mistake: The threat to Roe is real and immediate. President Bush has already put two anti-choice justices on the Supreme Court, where reproductive freedom now hangs by a thread. More than 450 anti-choice measures have been enacted by the states since 1995. 
   Recently, South Dakota enacted a ban on abortion in nearly all circumstances, even when a woman's health is at stake, even when she is the victim of rape and incest. And South Dakota is not alone. Several other states are considering similar bans. 
   The extremists behind these abortion bans make no secret about their goal. They want to use these laws to overturn Roe, and they think that the changes on the Supreme Court give them a chance to do just that. 
   We must act now. That is why I am introducing legislation today to protect the reproductive freedom of women across America. 
   The Freedom of Choice Act writes Roe v. Wade into federal law. It says that every woman has the fundamental right to choose to bear a child; to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability; or, if necessary to protect the health or life of the mother, after viability. It says that we will not turn back the clock on the health and rights of women. And it says that we will take steps--as a Congress and as a country--to safeguard the dignity, privacy, and health of women now and for generations to come.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this bill is part of the special interest agenda being pushed by the NRA and the Republican leader. First they managed to stall the reauthorization of the assault weapon bank, even though the bill saved lives and kept out police officers safer. Now they are looking to grant sweeping protections to gun manufacturers and dealers who recklessly sell guns that cause thousands of deaths in this country each year. 
   Contrary to what supporters of this bill are saying, this is not ``tort reform'' and this will not, as the White House said, ``help curb the growing problem of frivolous lawsuits.'' 
   They call this bill the ``Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.'' They give it a nice name to make it sound like they are protecting trade. What if we called it the ``Shield Gun Makers From Lawsuits When Their Defective Gun Blows Your Child's Arm Off Act?'' Or, ``You're Off the Hook if You Sell Guns to Criminals and They Use Those Guns to Murder People Act?'' I guess those names just don't have the same ring to them. 
   How about a little truth in advertising here--``Protect the Unlawful Commerce in Arms Act?'' I don't think so. Make no mistake, this bill is an  erosion of victims' rights. This bill puts the gun industry ahead of the rights of individuals. Ahead of the Dix family. These are real people, real victims. The doors of the courthouse would have been shut to the family of Kenzo Dix, who ultimately settled with Beretta. 
   This case was brought by the parents of Kenzo, a 15-year-old boy who was unintentionally shot and killed by a young friend with a defectively designed gun. Kenzo's friend Michael thought that he had unloaded his father's gun when he replaced the loaded magazine with an empty one. But the design of the gun failed to reveal the hidden bullet in the chamber, and this bullet killed Kenzo. 
   Beretta could have easily designed the gun with inexpensive, well-known features that would have prevented Kenzo's death. They could have included an internal lock to prevent Michael from firing the gun, or an effective loaded-chamber indicator to alert Michael that the gun was loaded. Although Beretta was long aware of the need for these features, it refused to include them. 
   Imported guns are subject to safety standards. But because domestic firearms are currently exempt from Federal consumer product safety oversight, the Consumer Product Safety Commission cannot compel gunmakers to include needed safety devices, as it routinely does with manufacturers of other products. 
   So court cases like Dix v. Beretta are the only way we can ensure gunmakers do the right thing. It is the only way. We know that just 1 percent of the gun dealers supply 57 percent of the guns used in crimes. None of us can ever forget the terror and horror wrought by the DC-area snipers. And no one here can forget the role that Bull's Eye Shooter Supply of Tacoma, W.A, played in that terror. Bull's Eye says it ``lost'' the assault rifle used by the DC area snipers to murder 12 people. 
   In just 3 years, Bull's Eye says it managed to ``lose'' 237 other guns as well. This is unbelievable. How did Bull's Eye ``lose'' all of those weapons? Clearly, the victims of Bull's Eye's gross negligence should have their day in court. In all it supplied guns traced to at least 52 crimes. 
   But if the Senate caves to the gun lobby and passes this bill, dealers like Bull's Eye will be able to continue business as usual. This bill eliminates any real incentives for the gun industry to act more responsibly. This can only result in more victims in the future like those killed by the DC area snipers. 
   This bill would bar cases including those brought by two New Jersey police officers, David Lemongello and Ken McGuire. They won a settlement from a pawn shop dealer who negligently sold twelve guns to a straw purchaser. 
   How does a straw purchaser work? This is one way: A criminal wants to buy several guns for his gang. He knows he can not buy it because he is a felon. So he gets his girlfriend who does not have a criminal record to go to the sales counter with him, and she buys the guns for him. The gun dealer knows something is wrong here, this young woman wanting to buy all these guns, but the dealer wants the money and goes ahead and sells the guns to the girl. 
   As a result of the police officers' suit, the West Virginia dealer changed its policies and now no longer engages in large-volume gun sales. Two other dealers in the same town also changed their policies. So the lawsuit brought about responsible behavior and our people are safer. 
   I want my colleagues to consider the outcome of this lawsuit. For two brave police officers, justice was done. The dealer was held accountable for its reckless sale to a straw purchaser, and now the dealer operates more responsibly. And no one declared bankruptcy. 
   This outcome was only possible because this special interest immunity bill had not yet become law. 
   Police and big city mayors oppose the bill before us. They say it will just make battling illegal guns more difficult and make police officers' lives more dangerous, more deadly. They oppose immunizing gun manufacturers against civil liability because it would remove much of their legal incentive to behave responsibly. It would just encourage bad manufacturers to remain bad, while giving good manufacturers the green light to become lax. 
   In my home state of California, we used to have a law that shielded gunmakers from liability, but the governor signed legislation repealing that law 2 years ago. Today in California, gun manufacturers like everyone else are responsible for making their products as safe as they can be. 
   We are safer today in California, but that margin of safety will disappear if Congress gives the gun industry special legal immunity. 
   In 1999, the late Senator John Chafee and I introduced the Firearms Rights, Responsibilities, and Remedies Act, which would have preserved the right of local governments and individuals to hold the gun industry accountable for avoidable gun violence. 
   Congress not only failed to pass our bill; the House and now many of my colleagues have charged off in the opposite direction to protect gunmakers while putting the rest of us at greater risk. 
   Who do we represent here? I ask my colleagues that we think about the 30,000 Americans killed every year by guns, and 12,000 children wounded each year by guns. 
   I urge my colleagues to listen to the police officers walking the beat, to Lynn Dix, the mother of Kenzo Dix, and to all the other mothers who have lost their children to gun violence, and to victims of the DC snipers' rampage. Listen to them and vote against this extremist bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today in Glendale, CA, there was a tragic commuter train crash. All of the details of the crash are not available at this moment. However, at least 10 people were killed and over 100 injured. The National Transportation Safety Board has already sent a team to investigate. 
   I have been talking about the problem of grade crossings and the need for grade separations for several years. 
   According to the Federal Railroad Administration, ``grade crossings are the site of the greatest number of collisions and injuries'' in the railroad industry. In 2000, there were 3,502 incidents at grade crossings. 
   In addition, the large volume of freight train traffic from California's ports to the rest of the Nation is a public safety hazard on many communities  in California where traffic, including emergency vehicles, is severely delayed at these grade crossings. 
   In Riverside, CA, from January 2001 to January 2003, trains delayed ambulance and fire protection 88 times. This translates into more people possibly dying from health emergencies such as heart attacks and larger and more deadly fires. If there is another terrorist attack, imagine what would happen if emergency first responders could not get across the tracks. 
   To address the safety problem of accidents and other safety hazards at grade crossings, I am introducing the Rail Crossing Safety Act, part of which passed the Senate twice in the last Congress as part larger railroad bills considered in the Commerce Committee. 
   This legislation would direct the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with State and local government officials, to conduct a study of the impact of grade crossings both on accidents and on the ability of emergency responders to perform public safety and security duties. This would include the ability of police, fire, ambulances, and other emergency vehicles to cross the railroad tracks during emergencies. 
   The second part of the legislation would authorize funds for the Secretary of Transportation to provide grants to State and local governments to undertake grade separations, in other words to build bridges and tunnels. 
   Today's incident in Glendale only underscores the needs to make our streets and rail lines safer. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today is a very somber day. The U.S. military death toll reached 2,000 in Iraq, a figure that I--and every American--hoped we would never reach. Our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones. 
   I pray for these young Americans, may they rest in peace; and I pray for their families, may they heal. 
   Let us honor their lives and their memory. 
   And let us honor the lives of those who continue to serve by developing a credible plan for Iraq. It is time for this administration to level with the American people and provide a strategy for success. 
   As the current investigation into the leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame reminds us, this administration took us to war on false intelligence, misstatements, and exaggerations. 
   This administration told the American people that we had no other option but to go to war because the regime of Saddam Hussein posed a threat to the security of the United States. However, no weapons of mass destruction have been found, and there was no serious link between Iraq and al-Qaida. 
   The administration also provided rosy scenarios and false expectations about how the United States would be greeted as liberators in Iraq and how the war would be brief. In fact, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld actually said in February 2003 that the war ``could last six days, six weeks. I doubt six months.'' 
   Yet here we are, 2 1/2 years later, lamenting the death of the 2,000th soldier in Iraq. Of those 2,000 soldiers, 464 of these soldiers were either from California or based in California. 
   Even as attacks on American soldiers continue, the administration refuses to level with the American people. In May 2005, Vice President Cheney proclaimed that: ``I think the level of activity that we see today in Iraq from a military standpoint, I think will clearly decline. I think they're in the last throes, if you will, of the insurgency.'' 
   Since that day--since Vice President Cheney told us that violence was coming to an end in Iraq--more than 300 Americans have lost their lives. And the violence continues to escalate. 
   Today we do not just lament the strategic disaster in Iraq, the loss of U.S. credibility around the world, and the overwhelming costs to the American taxpayer. Above all, we mourn the tragic deaths of 2,000 young Americans. 
   These men and women voluntarily put their lives on the line to defend us when they put on the uniform of the United States Armed Forces. They put their trust in the Government that we would only send them to war if there was no other recourse. 
   In rushing to war, in twisting and revising the case for war, and in failing to plan for the aftermath of the war, this administration broke the trust with these young men and women at a catastrophic cost. 
   These 2,000 young men and women have sons and daughters, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, friends and extended family, all of whose lives have been forever changed by the consequences of this reckless war. 
   Today, let us remember these 2,000 brave Americans. Let us honor their lives and their memory by bringing this war to an end.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I had hoped to be in California working in the State. I had a very important speech to give on Iraq to a very important group in Los Angeles. Instead I am going to give that talk here for the next few minutes so that my constituents will get the views that I have at this moment in time on that war. 
   In 1968, Martin Luther King told us:  
   If we do not act, we shall surely be dragged down the long, dark and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess ..... strength without sight.  
   Dr. King was talking about ending the Vietnam war. But 40 years later his warning is increasingly relevant to the Iraq war. 
   Strength without sight has now led us into a war based on mistaken intelligence, and down a thorny path of pain for far too long. None of us can afford to be silent. 
   Again, I want to quote Martin Luther King who said:  
   Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.  
   Martin Luther King said:  
   Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.  
   We must have the courage to speak out about things that matter, and, if we disagree about things that matter, that is part of the process. But let us heed Dr. King's words. It matters that 2,158 service men and women have given their lives in Iraq, leaving their families grieving. It matters that 16,155 have been wounded, many with scars that will last a lifetime. 
   It matters that the majority of the American people are demanding a new strategy so that we do not have a war without an end. 
   We saw 79 Senators from both political parties recently back an amendment saying that it is the Iraqis who should take the lead in providing their own security next year. Next year is a few days away. 
   I think it matters if 79 Senators vote for that amendment. 
   I see Senator Levin on the Senate floor. I thank him for that work he put into that amendment because it says very clearly that next year the Iraqis have to take charge of their own destiny. 
   We heard Congressman Jack Murtha's brave statement against this war, calling it a ``flawed policy wrapped in illusion.''

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I had tried to get time earlier in the day. Unfortunately, I was tied up in a markup. I want to express myself briefly on the constitutional amendment. 
   I opposed it, even though clearly it was far more popular in the country to support it. I did so because of my love of our country, our Constitution, and our freedoms. The love of country runs deep in my veins, as I know it does in those of every Senator. 
   My family came here in the early years of the 20th century to be safe from the Holocaust in Europe, the nightmare that took the lives of our relatives and so many innocent people. To my family and to me, America was not only a land of strength and courage but a land of compassion and acceptance. My father, who was a CPA, always said to me: Kiss the ground when you pay your taxes to America because you are helping to build our military, our schools, our roads, and our infrastructure. 
   My mother said that being an American meant being free to live your dreams, and only in this country, she would say, in America, where she was brought as a baby by her family, would that be possible. 
   I was taught not to be afraid of disagreement, not to fear words and not  to shrink from an argument in this, the greatest country on Earth. In a great country like the United States of America, you don't fear dissent. In a great country you allow dissent, even if it is ugly, even if it makes you sick to your stomach, even if it disgusts you. We are so strong as a Nation that we know if someone takes one of our beautiful symbols and destroys it or burns it or spits on it or steps on it, that person will not win respect but will lose it. That person will not win friends but in fact will turn people away. That person will gain nothing for his cause but, in fact, will be ridiculed and marginalized. 
   Now if a flag is burned or if a copy of the Bill of Rights or a copy of the Constitution is burned and that act is meant to incite others and it places people in danger, we should have laws to punish those who would endanger other lives. That is why I was proud to support the Bennett-Clinton-Durbin amendment, to do just that. I can certainly understand how seeing our flag burn would inflame passions and incite outrage. It does so in me. 
   The flag to me is a symbol of something I hold near and dear to my heart--our democracy, our country, our history. And I am outraged when I think about someone treating the flag in a disrespectful manner. But I am also outraged when I see or hear about a group of people protesting at the funeral of a fallen soldier, saying things like ``thank God for dead soldiers'' or ``God is America's terrorist.'' That is what is going on today at soldiers' funerals. 
   Such despicable speech and disrupting the most sacred funerals of our heroes makes no sense to me, and I can't begin to imagine the emotions of the families of the soldiers who must endure these senseless protests at a time of such loss. My instinct is to haul these protesters away. My colleague, Senator Durbin, proposed an amendment that would prohibit these awful protests at all funerals for our fallen heroes, regardless of where the funerals take place, whether at a national or private cemetery, a funeral home or a house of worship. I was proud to support that amendment, and I was stunned to see how many of my colleagues turned away from it. 
   I agree with the approach of Senator Durbin to the protests--proposing a statutory solution to address a problem rather than unnecessarily amending our Constitution. There are many things in life that we find offensive, repugnant to beliefs that we hold dear, but we cannot amend the Constitution every time there is something we consider outrageous, offensive, or repugnant. 
   We have only amended our Constitution 16 times after the Bill of Rights was passed in 1791--16 times over 214 years. But the Republican leadership has decided the best use of our precious little working time is to amend the Constitution--not amend it to guarantee equal rights for women, which still has not been done, not to amend it to allow limits on wealthy individuals buying Federal office--but for an issue which I believe we can address by statute, as I believe Senators BENNETT and CLINTON and DURBIN did. 
   Some have suggested that this constitutional amendment is necessary to honor our veterans. I think Senator Specter spoke eloquently on the point. I say, if we want to honor our veterans we should take care of our brave men and women in uniform who serve our Nation. 
   For example, just last week my good friend from Maine, Senator Snowe, and I were able to get an amendment agreed to by the Senate which would make all prisoners of war who die in captivity eligible for the Purple Heart. Also last week Senator Lieberman and I were able to get an amendment agreed to by the Senate improving the mental health screening and monitoring for members of our Armed Forces. 
   I think we honor our veterans and Armed Forces when we make sure that we are looking out for them, keeping our promises to them. Right now we are not. 
   We should provide them with all the equipment they need while they are deployed and all the health care they need when they come home. 
   Let's make sure our men and women have adequate body armor. Let's find ways to expand health care coverage for the members of the Guard and Reserves. Let's make sure the Veterans Administration is adequately funded to meet the needs of our veterans at a time when we are seeing horrific post-traumatic stress: suicides are up, divorces are up. These are 
   the ways we honor our veterans. 
   We love the flag--yes. We love our veterans--yes. But I think we can do both without having to amend the Constitution. 
   I believe the flag is a beautiful symbol of the freedom and liberty on which this proud Nation has been built. The flag is a reminder of the democracy we all hold so dear in our hearts. When I see the flag displayed in an inappropriate way--I think Senator Lautenberg showed it--on underwear or on pajamas, I don't think that is respectful. But that is what we see every day. I don't like it, but, you know what, this Constitution is more than an outlet for our justifiable frustrations. This Constitution is more than just an outlet for our justifiable frustrations. 
   It is concise. It has worked. It is the enduring ideal of our Nation, and we should not unnecessarily amend it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in March 2000, I introduced legislation to deal with the high price of gasoline. At the time, the price of gasoline had reached a startlingly high $2.15 per gallon in California. Today, gasoline prices on average in California are $2.43 per gallon, 13 percent higher. The problem is getting worse, not better, and so today I am reintroducing my bill to control the manipulation of gasoline prices. 
   We have heard that higher gasoline prices are due solely to higher crude oil prices. I just do not buy it. 
   According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, from January 17 through April 11, the cost of crude oil rose 10.8 percent. During the same time period, the average retail price of gasoline in the United States rose 24.9 percent. Something is not right. 
   Look at the profits that are being pocketed by the big oil companies. Compared to the same time last year, oil companies' first-quarter profits are dramatically higher. 
   Look at the number of mergers and acquisitions in the industry over the past several months. The continued consolidation only reduces competition and increases energy costs. 
   Look at the refiners that may be taking plants off-line at will for ``routine  maintenance,'' which is reminiscent of the electricity crisis when generators took their plants off-line for ``routine maintenance'' in order to artificially increase prices. 
   My legislation will shed light on manipulation and hopefully curtail it. 
   The bill requires the Federal Trade Commission to automatically investigate the gasoline market for manipulation anytime average gasoline prices increase in any State by 20 percent in a period of 3 months or less and remain at that level for 7 days or more. 
   Market manipulation would include, but it is not limited to, collusion or the creation of artificial shortages such as unnecessarily taking refineries off-line. In determining the trigger, the gasoline price used would be the Energy Information Agency's weekly pricing of regular grade gasoline. A report on the FTC's investigation would be due to Congress 14 days after the price trigger. 
   Under the bill, the FTC would be required within 2 weeks of issuing the report to hold a public meeting to discuss the findings. If the finings indicate that there is market manipulation, then the FTC would work with the State's attorney general to determine the penalties. 
   If the findings indicate that there is no market manipulation, then the U.S. Department of Energy must officially decide, within 2 weeks, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should be used in order to ease prices and stabilize supply. 
   We need to deter market manipulation. Otherwise, we risk serious price gouging with no accountability to consumers. My legislation offers a reasonable standard for an investigation and a reasonable time frame in which to complete that investigation. I believe the threat of these investigations and the public light that would be shed on the system will keep gasoline prices down. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today we in the Senate are finally apologizing to the descendants of the nearly 5,000 victims of lynching, primarily African Americans, for our failure to enact antilynching legislation. 
   Even though the House of Representatives passed three strong antilynching measures between 1920 and 1940, the Senate filibustered all of those measures. This was wrong, and this resolution is long overdue. 
   Lynching, a widely acknowledged practice that continued until the middle of the 20th century, was a shameful chapter in our history. It was mob justice at its most heinous, motivated by racial and ethnic hatred. And it was a national problem occurring in all but four States in our country. 
   While passing this apology is important, it not going to right every wrong. And it does not absolve us of our responsibility to continue to work to provide justice in American society. 
   Justice at the polls for those who are made to stand in line for hours to exercise their right to vote. 
   Justice in the schools so that every child has an equal educational opportunity. 
   Justice in the workplace so that no worker will face discrimination. 
   Let us use this opportunity not only to apologize for a shameful injustice but to dedicate ourselves to eradicating the remaining injustices in our society.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, for several years now we have been debating a national energy policy. In 2002 and 2003, I voted against the Energy bills because I believed they were bad for California and emphasized expanding old, dirty sources of energy instead of investing in clean, renewable energy. 
   Today's bill, however, is slightly better. It is more balanced and more protective of consumers. I will, therefore, vote for it. 
   However, this is not a perfect bill, and it contains many provisions that I oppose. I am voting to move the process forward today, but if the bill returns to us from conference more like the House bill, I will have to vote against it. 
   Let me begin with how this bill is better than previous bills. For the first time, we have an Energy bill that creates a Renewable Portfolio Standard, RPS. What that means is that utility companies will have to get 10 percent of their energy from renewable resources, such as wind and solar, by the year 2020. That is enough to supply 56 million U.S. homes with electricity generated by renewable sources. 
   There are a variety of other provisions in the bill that will encourage conservation, energy efficiency, and development and use of clean sources of energy. For example, there are $6.4 billion in tax breaks in the bill to provide incentives for alternative and renewable fuels. That includes something I have been advocating for several years--extending and strengthening the tax break for people who purchase hybrid cars. It also includes a tax deduction for energy-efficient buildings, the production of energy-efficient appliances, and the expansion of the credit for environmentally friendly geothermal facilities. 
   Unlike previous Energy bills, this bill actually contains some protections for consumers. We in California know all too well what happens when energy companies are allowed to manipulate the market and gouge consumers. This bill specifically prohibits manipulative practices in the electricity market, and it contains provisions for better accountability and more transparency so that consumers can know what is happening. 
   Speaking of the electricity crisis in California, we are still waiting for the refunds that are owed to us. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, found that rates were unjust and unreasonable; they found that markets were manipulated. They have ordered some refunds, but California has yet to see a penny 4 years later. And FERC continues to drag its feet in ordering the full $8.9 billion that is owed to my State. 
   That is why I am pleased that this bill includes my amendment calling on FERC to conclude action on the refunds issue and requiring FERC, if it has not done so by the end of this year, to explain to Congress what exactly has been done and to spell out a timetable for the rest of the process. Californians deserve their refunds, and I hope my amendment will finally bring this matter to a conclusion. 
   I am also glad the Senate approved an amendment Senators Dorgan and Stabenow and I offered that requires the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the possible manipulation of the price of gasoline. We are seeing unprecedented prices at the pump that cannot be completely explained by the rise in crude oil prices. Oil companies should not be making undeserved, windfall profits at the expense of consumers who, in many cases, have no alternative but to drive to work. 
   While I oppose the ethanol mandate in this bill, I am pleased that the bill includes a proposal I originally offered with Senator Lugar to count each gallon of ethanol made from agricultural waste products as 2.5 gallons toward meeting the mandate. This will be a big help to both the farmers and consumers of California. I am also pleased that this bill contains my original proposal to provide grants for the construction of agricultural waste ethanol production facilities. 
   As I mentioned, one of the bad things about this bill is the ethanol mandate. Even with the Feinstein provision to exempt California during the summer months, I am still concerned about what this mandate will mean for future gasoline prices in my State. 
   I am also adamantly opposed to the provision of this bill that requires an inventory of energy resources in America's Outer Continental Shelf. This could easily lead to future oil and gas development in some coastal areas. And an ``inventory'' is not as innocuous as it sounds. It will be conducted with seismic airguns, which shoot sounds into the seafloor for mapping. These sounds can injure marine mammals and fish, possibly leading to beachings and reduced fish catches. 
   The bill grants FERC the sole authority over the siting of liquefied natural gas terminals onshore, denying States the right to have a say in the decision. 
   This bill lacks what is probably the surest way to reduce our crippling dependence on foreign oil--increasing mileage standards on automobiles. Raising the fuel economy of passenger automobiles to 40 miles a gallon by 2016 would save about 95 billion gallons of oil by 2016. 
   Finally, I want to mention my disappointment at this bill's heavy reliance on nuclear energy at a time when we still have no solution for the nuclear waste problem and still have safety concerns about nuclear facilities. The bill reauthorizes the Price-Anderson Act to put the taxpayers on the hook in case of an accident, and it provides tax incentives and loan guarantees to encourage the construction of more nuclear powerplants. This does not make sense. We are subsidizing and encouraging the production of more nuclear waste when we have no place to put it. 
   As you can see, this is not a perfect bill. But, again, I will vote for it today in order to move the process forward and because it is better than the previous two Energy bills. I hope that the Senate conferees will fight to maintain  the Senate's language during the conference. If they do not--if this bill returns to the Senate looking more like the backward-thinking House bill--I will have to vote against it.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I wanted to say to my colleague from Delaware that he painted a very strong case of what we ought to be doing on the Senate floor. Without reading a note, he ticked off a list of six or seven things or eight things that we really need to take care of, and I just wanted to thank him very much. 
   I rise today to oppose the proposed constitutional amendment on marriage. I oppose it. I think it is divisive. I think it is unnecessary. I want to lay out the reasons. 
   First of all, the proposed amendment is nothing more than a cynical election year ploy. I truly believe that, and I think if anyone has followed this every-couple-of-year debate, they know it is true. It pops up like clockwork around election time. 
   Second, the definition of marriage, as has been stated by Senator Carper from Delaware, who was the Governor of that State, has been determined by the States, and indeed the States are acting in many ways to decide whether they want to legalize gay marriage or legalize domestic partnerships or civil  unions or outlaw all of these things. So States are making their decisions, and they should be respected. 
   On a personal note, let me say that I have been married for 44 years to the same person. I have to say as someone married for that length of time, the fact that two gay people decide they want to take care of each other for the rest of their lives and care about each other for the rest of their lives, that doesn't threaten my marriage one bit. It doesn't threaten me. It doesn't make me worry about my marriage. My marriage is too strong for that. The fact is, if someone feels their marriage is threatened because two gay people care about each other, then their problems go way deeper than they are caring to admit. 
   Throughout our Nation's history, we have only amended the Constitution to extend rights and equality, and that is an important point. So I think we have established in this debate that the States are taking care of this issue, and they are coming out in all different places. 
   That is the way it ought to be. 
   So here we are, June 2006, with only a few precious months left on the Senate calendar, and we are facing some very serious issues at a critical time in our history. It is our duty to respond to the American people and their needs. I truly believe that this President and the Republican leadership are ignoring the needs of the American people, and that is why we see the lowest ratings ever--I think ever--for this particular Congress and very low ratings for the President. 
   For example, what do President Bush and the Republican leadership say to the families of our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan who want to know when their loved ones will be coming home? Why aren't we talking about that instead of an issue that is being handled by the States? Maybe they don't answer that question because they don't want to say that the war in Iraq has killed and wounded over 20,000 American soldiers, and there is no end in sight to the war. 
   That brings up an issue that I care a lot about, which is the state of our military men and women. If you want to talk about their marriages for a minute, why don't we do that? Divorces are up, way up, among families who are deployed to these war zones. Families are suffering. The divorce rate between 2000 and 2004 nearly doubled in the Army, and it did not double in the Army because two people who happen to be of the same sex care about each other and want to take care of each other for the rest of their lives. That is not why military marriages are failing. They are under stress, impossible stress, the hard-to-imagine stress of being deployed again and again and again, going out on a battlefield with antidepressants being handed out to them. That is why they are suffering. That is why we see their marriages breaking up and their children crying themselves to sleep every night. But, oh no, we are not talking about that. We are talking about an issue that is being handled by the States. 
   I don't understand why this administration will not talk about these issues. Why won't they talk about the fact that we have lost our focus in Afghanistan, despite the fact that a resurgent Taliban has vowed to step up attacks during coming months and we are seeing such a resurgence of the Taliban there. Why aren't we discussing that instead of a cynical and divisive and unnecessary constitutional amendment about something that is being taken care of by the States? 
   What do President Bush and the Republican leadership say about our security here at home? What they don't want to say is that nearly 5 years after 9/11 they still have not adopted the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Shouldn't we be discussing ways to secure our ports and our rails, and ways to track foreign visitors in the U.S., instead of this cynical, divisive and unnecessary constitutional amendment on a subject that is being handled by the Governors and by the States? 
   Why do President Bush and the Republican leadership say nothing about gas prices? Why are they doing nothing about gas prices? Maybe it is because they don't want to say that they don't have any solutions--like raising fuel economy standards in a meaningful way or strongly promoting the use of hybrid cars or flex-fuel vehicles so we use less gasoline. This President tomorrow could issue an Executive order that says all the cars that are bought by Federal taxpayers for the Federal fleet have to be the most fuel efficient cars available. They are not doing that. They would rather talk about this amendment, which is about a subject that is being handled by the States. 
   What does the President and what do the Republicans and the leadership say to the millions of Americans who need access to affordable health care? They don't want to talk about that. They want to talk about this divisive amendment. Maybe it is because they have no clue of what to do, even though health care costs continue to be a tremendous burden on our small businesses and our individuals and our families, and the prescription drug benefit is rife with problems. 
   Tomorrow we could vote to give Medicare the power and the authority to negotiate for lower drug prices, which would save that program millions, and we would be able to make the program stronger and not put a halt to the benefits, which is called a doughnut hole, just when the sickest patients need more. Oh, no, they would rather talk about an amendment on a divisive subject that is being handled by the States. 
   Why don't they talk about the fact that our families are struggling to pay for college tuition for their children? They don't want to talk about that because they have failed to help America's families pay for college, despite the fact that tuition is becoming hugely expensive and more expensive each and every year. As a matter of fact, President Bush just signed a tax law that makes college loans more expensive. But, oh no, we can't talk about that. We are going to talk about a divisive amendment on a subject that is being handled by the States. 
   Why don't they want to talk about our fiscal situation? Why don't they? They don't want to say that as a result of their policies, the policies of this administration and my Republican friends, we now have seen the surpluses that were left to them, to their stewardship, turn into deficits as far as the eye could see. They are projected to hit well over $300 billion, and the public debt stands at an eye-popping $8.4 trillion. When they got the reins of Government there were going to be surpluses as far as the eye can see. Now there are deficits as far as the eye can see. 
   They don't want to say that it is this administration's failed policies that will leave our children and grandchildren with a bill for the tax cuts to the wealthiest people, tax cuts that we can't afford. 
   How do they really respond to the concerns and 
   the anxieties of the American people, anxieties and concerns that we see in poll after poll? This is not Democratic polls or Republican polls, these are everybody's polls. People are worried. They say we are on the wrong track. 
   But this is what this administration says, and this Congress, they say: Sorry, America, please hold. Please hold, America, while the Senate takes time to consider a constitutional amendment that has nothing to do with the most serious issues you face today. Why? Because they need to score political points. Please hold, America, because, although we have been elected to serve you and unite you, we would rather divide you for our own partisan interests. 
   If I were a conservative I would be insulted today, insulted by the fact that I am being used as a political pawn by this President and the Republican leadership. I would be insulted. 
   The issue of marriage has been determined by the States. For those people who worried about it, there was DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act. I believed at the time that wasn't even necessary because I believe the States have the right to make decisions about marriage. But it passed and it has been upheld. So what is the problem? There is not a problem. 
   From the party that says let the States decide, suddenly the States do not know as much as these Senators here. They know everything, and they are going to amend the Constitution on something that the States are handling. 
   This, in many ways, is a telling moment for this Senate. With all the issues I have laid out and the issues  that Senator Carper has laid out, there is no planning for these issues. So this Senate is being used as part of a political campaign. I resent that, when we have men and women dying every single day in Iraq, newspaper reporters being blown up. But we have to talk about a subject that is being handled by the States. 
   As I said before, we have never amended our Constitution to take away rights. We don't do that in America. We are too strong for that. We are too good for that. We are a model of freedom because of that. But that is precisely what is being proposed here, an amendment that is unnecessary because the States are handling this and all this does is divide us instead of uniting us. 
   Look at some of the great examples of our constitutional amendments. 
   The Bill of Rights--the first ten amendments--guarantee important liberties to Americans, from freedom of speech to freedom from unwarranted search and seizure to freedom of religion. And the 10th amendment reserves for the States all powers not specifically given to the Federal Government. 
   The 13th, 14th and 15th amendments corrected the horrific injustices of slavery by giving African-Americans the right to vote and equal protection under the law. 
   The 19th amendment gave women the right to vote, and the 26th amendment gave 18-year-olds the right to vote. 
   This short but impressive list of amendments demonstrates that our Constitution is meant to expand, not restrict, freedom and equality. 
   I want to say to my colleagues that there is something about this debate that has bothered me. As I have listened to some of my colleagues comment in support of this proposed amendment--which is their total right to support--I have been troubled by the suggestion that gay Americans are responsible for a host of problems in our society, from children born out of wedlock to poverty to divorce. These comments are wrong. These comments are wrong. It is wrong to find scapegoats in our great country. Gays and lesbians, they are God's children too. They wake up every morning, they try to do the best to live their lives, the best for the people they love. And they live their lives one day at a time. 
   We can solve problems such as unintended pregnancies, poverty, divorce, and adoption without stooping to scapegoat and hurt so many people. 
   If we want to strengthen families, let's strengthen families. Let's help families with their college tuition. Let's help families with their child care. Let's help them by raising the minimum wage. Let's clean up Superfund sites that are near schools. Let's help the 44 million Americans who need health insurance. Let's help those who are reaching retirement age, who are so frightened because the promise of the golden years is not there. 
   Let's reach out to each other and do that instead of being forced to deal with manufactured political issues which, again, pop up every election year. That sends false hopes out to some Americans who really want this constitutional amendment. They are being used. It also sends out fear and sadness to so many other Americans. 
   We can do better. We must do better for all Americans. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when I look at the distribution chart showing who benefits from the bill before the Senate, my question is, whose side are we on, anyway? I hope the answer to that question is, the majority of the American people. 
   When we look at this chart, what we find is we are on the side of not even 1 percent of the American people. We are on the side of those earning over $1 million a year. That is who gets the benefits of this bill.  
   According to The Urban Institute-Brookings Tax Policy Center, we see that the average tax cut of those over $1 million is $41,977 a year in this bill. The benefit of this tax break is essentially more than what some middle class Americans earn all year. 
   Then we have an additional number from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. Their chart shows if you earn over $1.6 million, this Republican tax bill will get you back $82,000 each and every year. Well, what is someone who earns, say, $40,000 getting back? Forty-six dollars--not even enough in some cases to fill up a gas tank. 
   Whose side is this Republican Senate on? If this 
   were a time when we did not have deficits and we did not have debt, it would be one thing. I still would oppose this bill. I would rather give the benefits to those in the middle. I would rather give the benefits to those who were struggling with the high cost of gas. I would rather give the benefits to those who are struggling to send their children to college. 
   By the way, in this particular bill, the college tuition tax deduction, so popular with middle-class families, was not included. The Republicans took it out in order to help the wealthiest Americans and, by the way, big oil. Big oil gets big tax breaks in this bill, $5 billion strong. 
   Here we have a circumstance where the millionaires and the oil companies win and middle-class America and working-class America, 99 percent plus, lose. 
   No wonder there is change in the air. People are saying, Enough is enough. Colleagues, we can say enough is enough today by voting down this ill-conceived, unfair bill that punishes most Americans, except for big oil and the very wealthiest few. 
   Yes, there is a one-year fix to the alternative minimum tax in here. For that, I am grateful. Yet, still, that good fix is far outweighed when you look at the distribution tables. You can see who gets the benefits. Twenty dollars for regular working and middle-class American families is the average tax cut; $20 a year, while people making over $1.6 million get up to $82,000 a year. 
   This is America. This country is great because we believe in our middle class. We know our working people are the engine of our economy and the pride of our Nation, yet we have a table that shows that the middle class is not only forgotten, they are made fools of in this bill. 
   Yes, there is a fix to the AMT. Good. Outside of that, we have a situation where those who have, get more; those who have a lot, get even more; and the oil companies that have been manipulating supply and hurting the American people get a tremendous amount. 
   That is how the tax break for big oil works. 
   See if you can follow me. They set the rules governing oil company profits so that if an oil company buys a lot of oil at a low price, say, $40 a barrel, and then they sell that oil at $70 a barrel, they get to pretend that they bought the oil at $70 too. You would think the difference between $40 and $70 would be their profit and what they would owe taxes on. 
   But under this bill, no, no, no. Their profits, and tax liabilities, are calculated on the price of oil on the day they sell the oil. So if they buy oil at $40 a barrel and sell it at $70, they do not pay any taxes on it because they are allowed to claim their costs are the same as their revenues--$70 a barrel. It is a giveaway to big oil, which is having the most unbelievable record profits, which we believe are manipulating supply, and which gives their CEOs a $400 million bonus package. This is what this Republican bill does. How they can even bring it to the Senate with a straight face is beyond me. But they have brought it to the Senate. I ask those moderate Republicans to join us and send a message that it is time to change. It is time to look at our middle-class families in California and all across this country and stand on their side--those struggling with the gas crisis, those struggling with health care, those struggling with college tuition. 
   This is a day when we ask the question, Whose side are we on? I hope the answer is, we are not on the side of the winners in this chart. The winners are the wealthiest among us and the oil companies. 
   Again, if this were a different time, if we did not have raging deficits, which we have had since this President took office, if we did not have a debt that is going so high that this Senate has to vote in the dead of night to raise the debt ceiling, if we were not in a terrible war that is killing our soldiers, with no end in sight and no plan in sight, that would be a different story, and we could say a rising tide lifts all boats, and we will give everyone a break. But those are not the times in which we live. 
   At the end of the day, the gimmicks that are used to pay for the tax breaks are just so many gimmicks because we know by putting the wealthiest in the Roth IRAs, there is an initial flush of money coming in, but at the end of the day the earnings in the Roth accounts are not taxable and will cost us billions of dollars in lost revenues. This bill will drive up our debt and deficits. 
   In closing, a recent NBC-Wall Street Journal poll asked Americans their top concerns. Do you think that Americans said, I want to give tax breaks to the oil companies? I want to give tax breaks to those earning $1.6 million a year? No, they said their top concerns were rising gas prices, Iran's nuclear ambitions, immigration, civil disorder in Iraq, the Bush administration leaking national security information, and Enron-style corruption. 
   What do we give them today, the American people? We give them everything they do not want, rewarding big oil and rewarding those who have not asked to be helped. They are doing fine. The people earning over $1.6 million a year are doing just fine. 
   We are giving the American people more deficits. We are giving them more debt. We are not helping middle-class families solve the problems of the raging costs of college tuition and the raging costs of gas prices. I hope we vote no on this bill. It is a bad bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. I have never had such a fantastic, underpaid, assistant in my life. 
   I will take a minute to explain why I am very delighted that Senators Gregg and Murray have signed off on this amendment we are about to adopt. 
   Senator Schumer has worked very hard on this issue. Here is what we say. We say the inspector general did an investigation and found out that on the out-of-place assets list--these are assets that the Department of Homeland Security will protect--were places such as the Nestle Purina Pet Food plant, the Sweetwater Flea Market, petting zoo, the beach at the end of a street, the Pepper and Herb Company, Auto Shop, groundhog zoo, high stakes bingo, mule day parade. 
   We wish we could protect every activity in America, but I think when you are looking at a budget that is limited, we should go after the targets that al-Qaida has told us--the bridges, the highways, the infrastructure, the chemical plants, the nuclear plants. We do not have to spend taxpayer money protecting the bourbon festival, as an example. 
   The point is, we are going to ask the Department to either accept the recommendations of the inspector general or tell us why not. That is the essence of the amendment. 
   I thank my colleagues. I don't know if I need to ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator from South Carolina. I thought he was going to make some comments about the vote that just took place on one of the most important issues facing the Senate. Instead, he launched into an attack on Senator HARRY REID. 
   Shakespeare once said something to this effect: When someone acts that way, he is protesting too much. So Senator Reid must have hit a chord with the Senator from South Carolina, and there are reasons for it. 
   Senator Reid speaks straight from the heart, straight from the shoulder. He is fighting for the American people. He wants us to fix the mess this President and this Congress made in the Medicare prescription drug benefit. He wants us to take care of our men and women in uniform. He wants to make sure the budgets are balanced. He wants to make sure that our families have health care, that we are moving forward on homeland security, and cleaning up the culture of corruption which has been brought to us by the ruling party. Remember, we have one party that rules Washington. 
   So I think his remarks must have deeply touched the Senator from South Carolina for him to launch into such a personal attack on the Democratic leader. I stand here and say: Keep it up, Senator Reid. You must be doing something right to elicit that kind of outrageous response. 
   Mr. President, many of us have been in elected life for more than a decade--in my case, three decades--and we know that when certain issues come before us, they are so profound, they are so important to the people we represent, they are such a watershed that they need to be marked, not rushed. 
   The vote on Samuel Alito to be a Justice of the Supreme Court is such a moment in our history. Yes, we are having two votes on this nomination, one just completed, which gave me and other opponents of the nomination an opportunity to signal that this nomination should be sent back to the President for a mainstream nominee in the mold of Sandra Day O'Connor. 
   We fell short of the 41 votes we needed to send this nomination back. But yet I am still glad I had the opportunity to go on record twice. And do you know why? Because the Supreme Court belongs to the people of America. It is their court. It is not George Bush's court. It is not any Senator's court. It is the people's court, and the highest court. It is their freedoms that are at stake, their protection from a power-hungry Executive, their right to clean air, to clean water, and safe communities, their right to make private decisions with their families, not with Senators and Congressmen and a President or Vice President breathing down their necks. 
   So although we knew the votes were not there for the filibuster of Judge Alito, we felt it was appropriate to use that historic Senate debate tool so the American people would know that we were willing to pursue even a losing effort because the stakes are so high. 
   Tomorrow, we will cast our votes on the nomination itself, and I want the record to reflect why I will be voting no.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take just a moment of the Senate's time to thank a few people who worked hard to put together a colloquy. This is a very important conversation between three Senators that deals with the critical issue of the health of our soldiers who are coming back from combat. So I will read this for the RECORD. 
   This colloquy is about a Comprehensive Casualty Care Center at the San Diego Naval Medical Center, and this is the colloquy. It starts off with myself saying:  
   I would like to thank the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii for their outstanding leadership on this bill and especially for their commitment to providing care for our Nation's combat-wounded servicemembers. 
   I understand that I have a commitment from both Senators that they will work to ensure that $6.2 million in funding is included in this bill for the establishment of a Comprehensive Combat Casualty Care Center at the San Diego Naval Medical Center. 
   This vitally important funding will ensure that for the first time, combat-wounded servicemembers from the West Coast--who have endured approximately 25 percent of all casualties--will be able to receive treatment and recover from their wounds closer to their home. 
   Since many of the most severely wounded require months of treatment and rehabilitation, this will alleviate significant hardship on our servicemembers and their families. No longer will they have to travel to Texas or to the East Coast for treatment. 
   This ``West Coast Walter Reed'' will be able to treat approximately 200 patients per year, including 160 nonamputee patients and 40 to 50 amputee patients. While I lament that even one more servicemember will be wounded in combat, I look forward to opening the center and to working with the Navy to ensure that our servicemembers are afforded the very best possible medical care.  
   That concludes my portion of this colloquy. I have been working with the Navy on this matter since they explained to us that so many of our west coast families have to be trekked all the way to the east coast for rehabilitation for these very severe injuries. The rehab is very intensive, and the whole family really needs to be included and involved in it. So now it is going to be so much easier for these active military from the State of Washington, from the State of Oregon, and I believe from Alaska, Hawaii, and even some other States such as Nevada that are east of California, to be able to avail themselves of the best treatment. I believe the Navy has been so focused on this that their dreams are becoming a reality. They are going to serve the military from all the various branches who get injured. It isn't just for the  Navy; it is for everyone who gets injured in a severe way and needs this extended rehabilitation. 
   So Senator Stevens, at the end of my remarks, said:  
   The Senator from California is correct. She has my commitment that I will work in conference to ensure that these funds are provided for the Comprehensive Combat Casualty Care Center.  
   Senator Inouye then said:  
   I too support the Senator's request. She has my commitment that I will do my best to ensure funding is included in conference.  
   I believe, after speaking with them--and I have spoken to Senators Murray and Cochran about this--that this is something that just cries out for funding because our people are hurting, and it doesn't help them to be separated from their families and to have to make the trek across the country to learn how to live with these very disabling injuries. So we pray that the war will end soon. We pray that our soldiers will be coming home soon. I myself am working to see that we can begin redeploying troops immediately. 
   I think as the Iraqis move forward, this is a year of major transition, and they need to prove that they want freedom as much as we want it for them. They now have their government getting into place, and I would like to see the end of these casualties. I know we all feel that way. But we have to also be realistic in that we have to serve those who are continuing to come back in great need of this kind of help. 
   So, again, I hope all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this effort. I look forward to working with all of you so that we can tell the Navy that their hopes and dreams for this Comprehensive Combat Casualty Care Center in San Diego at the Naval Medical Center, will, in fact, be a reality. The $6 million we need is a very small amount when you look at the overall size and scope of this particular bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to protect public health and the environment by preventing chemicals from leaking out of underground storage tanks and thereafter contaminating drinking water supplies and nearby communities. My colleague in the House of Representatives, Mr. DINGELL, is introducing companion legislation. 
   Underground storage tanks can hold extremely toxic chemicals that can move rapidly through soil, contaminating the ground, aquifers, streams and other bodies of water. Underground storage tanks are located in urban and rural areas. When they leak, they present substantial risks to groundwater quality, human health, environmental quality, and economic growth. 
   There are approximately 670,000 underground storage tanks in the United States, and there have been more than 445,000 confirmed releases from these tanks as of mid-2003. Over 35 States report that leaking underground storage tanks are one of the top threats to their drinking water sources. By and large, MTBE contamination has come from leaking underground storage tanks. MTBE has contaminated water supplies in 43 States and in 29 States has contaminated drinking water. Estimates indicate that it will cost at least $29 billion to clean up MTBE contamination nationwide. 
   Currently, the leaking underground storage tanks program and other laws ensure that responsible parties pay to clean up the damage caused by these leaking spills. Unfortunately, the pace of cleaning up leaking underground storage tanks is 20 percent below the historic average. Our Nation faces an estimated 94,000 to 150,000 additional cleanups over the next 10 years--at a cost of $12 billion to $19 billion. 
   The best, most commonsense solution to stop leaking underground storage tanks from threatening public health is to prevent them from leaking in the first place with the use of secondary containment, such as double walls. There is already widespread support for this throughout the country. Twenty-one States already require secondary containment, either for all new or replaced tanks--such as in California--or for all new or replaced tanks in sensitive areas. In addition, two States are awaiting final passage or approval of such requirements, and one State requires tertiary, such as triple walls, containment. According to figures from the Petroleum Equipment Institute, 57 percent of all tanks installed from 2000 through 2003 were double walled. 
   But this is not fast enough in the face of the threats to our drinking and groundwater. Approximately 50 percent of the population relies on groundwater for their drinking water, including almost 100 percent in rural areas. The time to prevent contamination is now. 
   We must ensure the environmental health and safety of our water. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I join Senator CLINTON in introducing the Count Every Vote Act of 2005. 
   The 2000 election exposed a number of serious problems with the accuracy and fairness of election procedures in this country, as well as the reliability of certain types of voting technology. As a result of those irregularities, many eligible voters were effectively disenfrachised and thus deprived of one of our most fundamental rights. 
   In the 2004 election, we again saw serious irregularities when voters across this country went to the polls to cast their votes. From untrustworthy electronic voting machines, to partisan secretaries of state, to outrageously long lines at the polls, the election system was far from what voters are entitled to have. 
   At Kenyon College in Ohio, for example, voters were made to wait in line until nearly 4 a.m. to vote because there were only two machines for 1,300 voters. In the Columbus area alone, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 voters left  polling places, out of frustration, without having voted. In Cleveland, thousands of provisional ballots were disqualified after poll workers gave faulty instructions to voters. 
   Because of these irregularities--as well as voting irregularities in many other places--I joined Congresswoman STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES of Ohio in objecting to the certification of the Ohio electoral votes on January 7, 2005. I did this to cast the light of truth on a flawed system that must be fixed now. Americans deserve a system where every vote is counted and can be verified. And, Congress must do more to give confidence to all of our people that their votes matter. 
   In 2002, Congress passed the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), which took important steps toward electoral reform. Since the enactment of HAVA, however, concerns have been raised about the security of voting machines and the inability of the majority of voters who may use these machines to be able to adequately verify their vote and to ensure that the vote they intended was both cast and counted. In addition, many other problems in our Federal election system--including long wait times in which to vote, the erroneous purging of voters, voter suppression and intimidation, and unequal access to the voting process--remain. 
   Last year, I sponsored legislation to address some of these issues. I also joined Senator CLINTON and former Senator Bob Graham in introducing an election reform bill. I am pleased to again join Senator CLINTON today to introduce the Count Every Vote Act of 2005--the CEVA Voting Act. It requires voting machines to have a voter-verified paper trail for use by all individuals, including language minority voters, illiterate voters, and voters with disabilities; and it mandates national standards in the registration of voters and the counting of provisional ballots. All provisions of this legislation are to be in effect no later than the November 2006 Federal election. 
   Mr. President, in a democracy, the vote of every citizen counts. We must make sure that every citizen's vote is counted--and counted accurately and fairly so that the American people have confidence in the results. HAVA was a good first step. The CEVA Voting Act is the next step, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations I Committee, Senator Lugar, in reintroducing the Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act. Today, we are reintroducing a bill that we worked on together in the 108th Congress--a bill that will help those most vulnerable to the HIV/AIDS pandemic throughout the world. 
   An estimated 14 million children have lost either one or both parents to HIV/AIDS. By the year 2010, It is estimated that this number will grow to 25 million. The pandemic has created an orphans crisis, especially in sub-Sahara Africa where this crisis is most severe. 
   The struggle of those orphaned by this pandemic is heartbreaking. These children face the trauma of watching their parents die. They are forced at a very young age to care for their younger siblings while suffering from deep poverty, hunger, and sicknesses. 
   A girl from Uganda who lost her parents to HIV/AIDS at age 11 told the BBC:  
   When my mother died we suffered so much. There was no food, and there was no one to look after us. We didn't even have money to buy soap and salt. We wanted to run away to our other grandparents, but we didn't have transport to go there. I tried to be positive, but it was difficult. I missed my mother because I loved her so much.  
   Picture this story repeated 14 million times throughout the world. We cannot stand by and allow this suffering to continue. 
   The Lugar-Boxer legislation that is being introduced today is designed to help these orphans and other vulnerable children who have been affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. 
   First, our bill would authorize the President to provide assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. Specific authorization is provided in the areas of basic care, HIV/AIDS treatment, school food programs, protection of inheritance rights, and education and employment training assistance. 
   Second, this legislation calls on the President to use U.S. foreign assistance to support programs that eliminate school fees. Throughout the world, many orphans are prevented from attending school because they cannot afford to pay school fees or are forced to financially support their families or care for sick relatives. 
   And, third, our bill would require the President to develop and submit to Congress a strategy for coordinating, implementing, and monitoring assistance programs for orphans and vulnerable children. 
   This strategy must include measurable performance indicators to ensure that our policies are effective in helping orphans and vulnerable children. 
   Once again, Mr. President, I thank Chairman Lugar for working with me on this bipartisan legislation. I also thank Congresswoman Lee for her leadership on this issue in the House of Representatives. 
   I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important bill.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote against this energy bill because it does not do enough to reduce our dependence on foreign oil through the promotion of alternative forms of energy or by encouraging energy efficiency. 
   I was very disappointed that the conference committee eliminated the Senate's renewable portfolio standard, under which utilities would have provided 10 percent of their total sales from renewable resources by 2020. In addition, the conference also eliminated the Senate provision that called on the President to find ways to reduce oil use by 1 million barrels per day by 2025, as well as the provision promoting hybrids for use in Federal, State, and other vehicle fleets. 
   I am also very concerned about an authorization for an inventory of energy resources in America's Outer Continental Shelf, which is damaging in itself and may lead to future oil and gas development in some coastal areas. 
   Overall, this bill is very imbalanced. The bill provides $5.7 billion in tax incentives over 10 years for the fossil fuel industry and $1.5 billion in subsidies and tax breaks for the nuclear industry. Compare this to tax incentives for renewable electricity, alternative vehicles and fuels, energy efficiency, and energy conservation, which were cut from $11.4 billion in the Senate bill to $5.8 billion in the final bill. 
   With all of these bad provisions, I am pleased that a few good provisions survived, such as my amendment calling on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to conclude action on energy crisis refunds by the end of the year or report to Congress explaining what it has done and specifying a timetable for the rest of their process 
   I am also pleased that this energy bill will exempt California from the proposed new ethanol mandate during the summer months, when ethanol usage in gasoline can increase air pollution, and that it included my original proposal to encourage the production of ethanol from agricultural waste. 
   Republicans removed many provisions from the Senate bill that would have put us on a more energy-efficient path, and unfortunately we were left with a bill that does not offer the sound and innovative policies we need to reduce our dependence on foreign  oil, protect the environment, and improve our energy and fuel efficiency.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before Senator Kerry leaves the floor, I want to thank him. The issues he raised absolutely have to be a part of this debate. I will address them after he leaves. The reason I stood up and objected to the Ohio count is because I knew firsthand from the people of Ohio who came and talked with me through STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES that they were waiting in lines for 6, 7 hours. That is not the right to vote. I think Senator Kerry's remarks and the remarks of the Senator from Oregon are very important. 
   So let a message go out from this Senate floor today that we are not stopping our efforts to make sure people can vote with the very important passage of this very important legislation. I am very pleased to follow him in this debate. 
   I rise to cast my vote in support of a very historic bill named after three amazing women whom I truly admire--Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King. These three legendary women were part of the heart and soul of the civil rights movement in this country, and those women helped move the conscience of this Nation in the 1960s and, frankly, inspired me to serve in public service. 
   In 1950, I was a little girl and I was in Florida with my mother. I went on a bus. It was a crowded time of day. A woman came on the bus. Her hands were filled with packages. To me she looked really old. I guess she was my age. I jumped up because I was taught to do that. I jumped up and I said: Please, please, take my seat. My mother kind of pulled at my sleeve, and the woman put her head down and she walked to the back of the bus. 
   I was perplexed by this. I said to my mother: Why was she rude to me? Why didn't she say thank you and take the seat? 
   My mother explained to me the laws in those days that sent African Americans to the back of the bus. I at 10 years old was astounded, shocked, angry. My mother said to me: Why don't we just stand up. And that is what we did. We walked to the back, and we stood. 
   That was an America that is no more, but that is an America we cannot forget. That was an overt law to hurt people, to make America ``we and them.'' That is why the law we are passing today is so important--because it says that we all recognize that even though that America is no more, we have more work to do. 
   And then came the sixties. Of course, we know it was Rosa Parks who changed the world with that one act of defiance of hers, where she just went on that bus and she wasn't going to the back. 
   When I met her, when President Clinton invited her to the White House and I went there, I stood in awe because it said to me how one person can make a difference in this, the greatest nation in the world. We get so frustrated sometimes; we feel we can't make a difference. Here is one woman saying, No, I won't do that; that's wrong; I'm one of God's children. And that act of defiance changed our country. I am so happy this bill is named after her and Fannie Lou Hamer who helped organize Freedom Summer in 1965 which helped lead to passage of this landmark bill we will vote on today. She had a very simple phrase that she used: ``Nobody's free until everybody's free.'' ``Nobody's free until everybody's free.'' That reminds us of the work that we certainly have to do today. 
   So Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King, who worked with her great husband during the civil rights movement in the sixties and carried on his work after his horrific assassination, working for justice, worked for equality not only in this country but around the world. 
   In the late eighties, she worked tirelessly to help bring an end to apartheid in South Africa. I often quote Martin Luther King, almost in every speech I give, because he is one of my heroes. One of the lines he said, which isn't really one that gets quoted all the time, is that ``Our lives begin to end when we stop talking about things that matter.'' ``Our lives begin to end when we stop talking about things that matter.'' That touched me and reached me. 
   I think his words, of course, reached every American, regardless of political party. Don't stop talking about things that matter, even though it might be easier to do so, even though it might be easier when you are at a friend's house and somebody says something that is bigoted toward somebody else. It is sometimes easier for us to make believe we didn't hear it. No, that matters, you matter, your view matters, your values matter. Speak up. 
   That is what we are doing, and I am proud to be in the Senate today because we are doing something good today. It is a privilege and an honor to vote for this reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. 
   I had a number of people visit me from my State yesterday--old and young, children, grandmothers, great grandmothers, granddads, lawyers, workers, doctors. 
   They just jammed into my conference room and they said: Senator Boxer, we know you are with us. We know you have been on this bill. We know where you are. We have listened to you all these years. We wanted to come here and say thank you. 
   I said: You don't need to thank me. What you need to do is join with me so that after this vote, we truly get equal voting rights in this country.  
   That was touched on by Senator Kerry, and it was touched on by Senator Wyden. The right to vote--without it we are nothing. Without it, we are not standing up for the principles upon which this Nation was founded: a government of, by, and for the people. 
   How do you have a government of, by, and for the people, if the people turn away from the voting booth? I hear every excuse in the world: Oh, you are all the same. What is the difference. I can't make a difference. It is just false. It is just an excuse. 
   Show me two candidates running against each other at a local level, at a State level, at a Federal level, and I will show you the differences. If you pay attention, you will find out the differences, and you will cast your vote for the candidate that most represents you. You are not going to agree with them 100 percent of the time. That is another issue: Oh, I used to agree with him, but he did three things, and I don't agree with him anymore. Look at the totality. Look at the totality of the voting record. Look at the totality of the opposition and make a decision. Don't just walk away. Don't pull the covers over your head with excuses: They are all alike. I can't make a difference. What is one vote? 
   We all know the election of John Kennedy was decided by a couple of votes per precinct. It could have been one vote per precinct. That is how close that election was. 
   In the voting booth, we are all equal. In the voting booth, we are all equal. Your vote and my vote, whether you are 18 years old or you are my age and a Senator, we are all equal in the voting booth. We have one vote. We should cherish it. The CEO of a giant company who earns multimillions of dollars a year is equal to a minimum wage worker. And if that minimum wage worker thinks it is time he got a raise or she got a raise after almost 10 years of not getting a raise, he or she ought to vote, and vote for the candidate who supports your right to join the middle class. 
   Every citizen of this country who is eligible to vote should be guaranteed that their vote is counted and that their vote matters. That is why it is so important that we maintain the protections of this historic Voting Rights Act, such as requiring certain localities with a history of discrimination to get approval from the Federal Government before they make changes to voting procedures. Why is this important? It is important because it is a check and balance on an area that has in the past not shown--not shown--the willingness to fight for every voter. And, requiring certain jurisdictions to provide language assistance to voters with limited English proficiency, and authorizing the Federal Government to send election monitors to jurisdictions where there is a history of attempts to intimidate minority voters at the polls, we just want to make sure these elections are fair, wherever they are held. 
   The Federal Government must work hard to guarantee that the inequities we have seen in the past never resurface again. And won't that be the day, when we have a system that we believe we can be proud of again. 
   I am proud to stand here today with an opportunity to cast a vote to reauthorize provisions of the Voting Rights Act. But today didn't come without struggle. Why did my people have to come all the way from California, spend their hard-earned dollars to get on a plane? I will tell you why: Because this was a hard bill to get before this body. People objected. People complained. It was a hard bill to get before the House. But many people worked hard, and House Members listened to the people, and Senators listened to the people. 
   I want to thank my friends at the NAACP who were finally able to convince enough that, yes, this was something we had to do. We have to be honest. There were attempts to weaken this bill, but we succeeded in not allowing that to happen. 
   In my closing moments, I want to say that our work does not stop today, as Senator Kerry said and as Senator Wyden said. For example, several of us have introduced the Count Every Vote Act, a comprehensive voting reform bill that will ensure that every American indeed can vote, and every vote is counted. 
   Congresswoman STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, who lived through a harrowing experience during the last election, with her constituents being given the runaround and standing in line for 6 and 7 hours. Is that the right to vote, standing in line for 6 and 7 hours, people who have to work, people who had health problems, people who couldn't stand up, people whose legs were weakening beneath them? Is that the right to vote? I say it is not the right to vote. I say it is harassment. 
   Senators CLINTON, KERRY, LAUTENBERG, MIKULSKI, and I have introduced the Count Every Vote Act, and I want to highlight the two key provisions that are in this bill. The first is the bill would require electronic voting machines provide a paper record which will allow voters to verify their votes, and it will serve as a record if a manual recount is needed. We go to a restaurant, we get a receipt. We go to the store, we get a receipt. We save it in case there is a problem. When we vote, we should get a receipt. We should look at it, we should check it, just as we add up the bill from the restaurant. We should give it back and then it is stored. In case there is a problem, we have a paper trail. 
   The second provision: We say election day should be a Federal holiday. We all give speeches. We stand up and we stand behind the red, white, and blue. What a great, free country this is, and indeed it is. Why shouldn't we make election day a holiday so that we can celebrate on every election day our freedoms, our history, our rights, our protections as citizens to choose our own leaders? 
   Let me say, we cannot even get to page 1 in terms of moving this bill forward. There is resistance to this bill. There are those in this body who don't want a paper trail. They don't want to make it easier to vote, and let's call it what it is. That resistance exists, and that is wrong. So I call on the leadership of this body: Let's do something more for people. Let's not have another situation where a Senator has to go over and protest a vote count because people said they had to stand in line for hours.

   Mrs. BOXER. Then we have the people of Washington, DC. They are not represented with a vote. That is wrong. Over 500,000 people live in this great city, the heart and soul of our democracy. Eighty percent are voting age. They can't cast their ballots in national elections for congressional representatives. They don't have Senators or Representatives here. That is why I have joined Senator JOE LIEBERMAN on his bill that calls for full voting rights for DC residents. 
   So, again, I say what a privilege and honor it is for me to be here, to stand here, thinking back to my days as a child when African Americans had to go to the back of the bus in some parts of the South, feeling the pain of that myself for those who had to live in that way. So this bill is a fitting tribute to Rosa Parks and Fannie Lou Hamer and Coretta Scott King. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer for his indulgence. This is a starting place for a lot of us, and we are going to make sure that, in fact, the right to vote is a reality for every single one of our citizens.

   Mrs. BOXER. I rise today to express my opposition to the amendment put forward by Senator Gregg to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill--an amendment to provide additional funding for border security at the expense of the U.S. Armed Forces. 
   While I certainly support the goal of providing an additional $1.9 billion to secure our Nation's borders, it is completely unconscionable to cut funding for our military men and women at a time when they are risking their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Let me explain how Senator Gregg's amendment would hurt our military. 
   The Gregg amendment cuts Department of Defense programs included in this bill. This includes critical funding, such as funding for the military personnel account--which provides pay and benefits for Active-Duty, Guard and Reserve troops--and the Defense Health Program, which is responsible for providing our troops with medical assistance. 
   Funding for the training of Iraqi security forces is included, as well. We know this mission is critical to our success in Iraq and the ability to bring home our brave servicemembers. 
   The bill also includes funding for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Fund, which provides assistance to our troops seeking to eliminate IEDs the leading cause of death for U.S. troops in Iraq. 
   Furthermore, the Death Gratuity Fund, which provides assistance to the families of fallen soldiers, is included in this bill. 
   Senator Gregg's amendment seeks to secure our borders but does so by reducing much-needed funding for the men and women fighting for our country every day. This is unacceptable. 
   While I oppose Senator Gregg's amendment, I am pleased to support Senator Reid's amendment. The Reid amendment also provides nearly $2 billion in additional funding for our Nation's border security but without dangerous funding cuts that would harm our troops.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will explain the amendment. I will do so quickly. 
   The Boxer amendment provides an additional $500 million per year for mental health services for our Nation's veterans over the next 5 years. This amendment is backed by the American Legion, AMVETS, and Disabled American Veterans. 
   We pay for this in a very simple way. We say the tax cuts of 2001 that have not yet taken effect for those earning over $1 million a year be deferred. We find that when we pay for this $500 million, we have millions left over to reduce the deficit. 
   In closing, let me tell my colleagues a story. 
   I got an e-mail from a woman who was married to CPT Michael Jon Pelkey, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder for over a year. He sought help on several occasions but was discouraged by the wait time  and the stigma. He thought his command would perceive him as worthless if he started therapy. 
   His wife wrote:  
   Michael passed away in our home at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest on November 5, 2004.  
   She said:  
   I feel that my husband is a casualty of this war and to date the Army has not [done enough for post-traumatic stress].  
   I know millionaires in California, and I know they would give up a tax cut to help--to help--our veterans who are fighting in deplorable conditions every single day. 
   I hope my colleagues will take a stand for our veterans and say to the millionaires of this country: We know you want to help them. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the fiscal year 2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations conference report. This conference report contains important funding that gives our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq the equipment and support they need. It also provides additional resources to help train new Iraqi security forces that will help speed the return of our servicemen and women. 
   In March, I traveled to Iraq to witness firsthand our military operations. There is no doubt that the insurgency is strong and that our continuing presence in Iraq, without even a goal for leaving, is fueling it. 
   Therefore, our troops are in grave danger every day, as evidenced by the tragic number of dead and wounded. Since the beginning of the Iraq War, we have suffered more than 1,600 deaths and more than 12,000 wounded. 
   My trip to Iraq confirmed my fears that not enough is being done to protect our soldiers from the threat of roadside bombs. Roadside bombs are one of the leading causes of death in Iraq and are responsible for 70 percent of those personnel killed or wounded. That is why I am glad that the conference report provides $60 million to rapidly field electronic jammers that help prevent the detonation of roadside bombs. This is consistent with the Boxer amendment that was adopted on the floor during the Senate's consideration of the bill. 
   I am also pleased that the conference report provides $150 million in additional funding for up-armored Humvees. While this is not as much as provided by the Bayh amendment, it is still a step in the right direction. 
   I will vote for this conference report, but I do so with serious reservations about the lack of an exit strategy in Iraq and with additional reservations about the way the REAL ID Act was attached to this legislation. 
   The REAL ID Act contains sweeping changes to our immigration laws. These provisions were not included in the President's supplemental appropriations request, nor were they included in the Senate version of the bill that was approved last month. 
   But at the insistence of the Republican leadership in the House, this legislation was attached to the House version of the emergency supplemental bill and then rammed through conference without the participation of Democrats. The REAL ID Act will become law without discussion or debate in the Senate. 
   The REAL ID Act contains a provision that would require states to collect documents proving the date of birth, social security number, principal address, and lawful immigration status for any applicant seeking a driver's license or identification card that would be recognized by the Federal government. States would be required to keep these documents on hand for a minimum of 7 years, maintain this information on a database, and allow electronic access to all other states. 
   States are understandably concerned that they do not have the capability to meet this mandate. Privacy concerns have also been raised. 
   Unfortunately, we have not had the ability to fully investigate the privacy implications and other issues related to this provision. My State of California has worked for 3 years trying to find a workable solution to this issue. But in the Senate, the REAL ID Act did not even warrant a hearing. This is why the National Governors Association, the National Council of State Legislatures, and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators all oppose this legislation. 
   The REAL ID Act also contains a troubling provision that allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive all legal requirements--including environmental laws--in order to build security fences along U.S. borders. Security fences can be built without waiving environmental laws. 
   So, while I will vote for this bill because it helps our brave and courageous troops, I am deeply distressed at the way Democrats were left out of all the immigration discussions.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we commemorate World Oceans Week, we celebrate the wonder and beauty of the world's oceans. We celebrate the role our oceans play in commerce, fishing and shipping. We celebrate the beauty of our coral reefs and the potential lifesaving cures they might contain. And we celebrate our commitment to improving the health of our oceans, so that our children and grandchildren will have a chance to enjoy and cherish them. 
   That is why I am pleased to introduce the National Oceans Protection Act of 2005--comprehensive legislation to improve the health and governance of our oceans. The bill is co-sponsored by Senator LAUTENBERG. 
   This legislation ``was written after two major oceans commission reports in the past two years determined that our oceans are in a state of crisis. The congressionally-established U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the independent Pew Oceans Commission provided detailed descriptions of the challenges our oceans are facing as well as specific solutions to improve ocean health. 
   From pollution to over-fishing to invasive species, there are many factors that have contributed to the current crisis in which we find ourselves. Pollution threatens all aspects of ocean health. Every 8 months, nearly 11 million gallons of oil flow from American roads into our waters--the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. 
   Our oceans are also showing signs of being over-fished, which affects the communities that depend on fish stocks for their livelihood. Many fish populations, including salmon, face the threat of being depleted to seriously low levels. Invasive species--such as the killer algae found near San Diego in 2000--are another threat to ocean health. In the San Francisco Bay alone, more than 175 invasive species threaten to overwhelm native species. 
   By targeting some of the most serious challenges facing our oceans, as outlined in the Commissions' reports, my legislation provides a comprehensive national approach to oceans protection and preservation. 
   Let me just mention a couple of the important provisions in four key areas: 
   First, the bill improves the governance of the oceans by giving the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the independence it needs to better facilitate the management and oversight of our oceans. 
   Second, the bill protects and conserves marine wildlife and habitat by, among other things, creating protection areas and authorizing $50 million per year in grants to local communities to restore fisheries and coastal areas. 
   Third, the bill strengthens fisheries and encourages sustainable fishing in a number of ways, including requiring that entire ecosystems be taken into account when considering the health of a fishery. 
   And, fourth, the bill improves the quality of ocean water by establishing maximum amounts of pollution that a body of water can hold and still be healthy. In addition, financial assistance will be provided to local governments to reduce pollution and increase monitoring. 
   For their contributions to this legislation and their great leadership on  oceans issues, I would like to thank Senators INOUYE, GREGG, LAUTENBERG, and LEVIN, as well as former Senator Hollings. 
   It is my hope that this bill will provide the framework needed to protect and improve our oceans. The great environmentalist and ocean-explorer Jacques Cousteau once said, ``If we were logical, the future would be bleak, indeed. But we are more than logical. We are human beings, and we have faith, and we have hope, and we can work.'' 
   As we celebrate World Oceans Week, it is my hope that we can work together to provide a bright future for the world's oceans and continue to protect our coastal economy. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to implement the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the Pew Ocean Commission.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I voted for the conference report because on balance I believe it is necessary legislation to give our law enforcement officials the tools they need to protect the American people from terrorist attacks. Before the Patriot Act, various law enforcement agencies did not have the ability to share information and work together, and this was a vulnerability that needed to be fixed after9/11. 
   But this was a difficult decision. The bill had flaws, and two in particular concern me the most the so-called ``sneak and peek'' and library search provisions. Given my concerns about these provisions, I voted for every opportunity to make further improvements to the bill. 
   But ultimately I believe that by voting for the conference report I will be in a stronger position to help improve the Patriot Act in the future, working with Judiciary Committee Chairman Specter, Ranking Member Leahy and Senators FEINGOLD and SUNUNU. 
   I also wanted to show my support for Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN's anti-methamphetamine bill, which was included in the conference report. Meth has become a terrible scourge across our country and Senator FEINSTEIN's bill will go a long way to combat the spread of the drug by restricting access to the ingredients used to make meth.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to name the Federal courthouse building now being completed at Tulare and ``O'' Streets in downtown Fresno, CA the ``Robert E. Coyle United States Courthouse.'' 
   It is fitting that the Federal courthouse in Fresno be named for Senior U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle, who is greatly respected and admired for his work as a judge and for his foresight and persistence that contributed so much to the Fresno Courthouse project. Judge Coyle has been a leader in the effort to build a new courthouse in Fresno for more than a decade. Indeed, he personally supervises this project. He is often seen with his hard hat in hand, walking from his chambers to the new building to meet project staff. 
   Judge Coyle, working with the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Eastern District, conceived and founded a program called ``Managing a Capitol Construction Program'' to help others understand the process of having a courthouse built. This Eastern District program was so well received by national court administrators that it is now a nationwide program run by Judge Coyle. 
   In addition to meeting the needs of the court for additional space, the courthouse project has become a key element in the downtown revitalization of Fresno. Judge Coyle's efforts, and those in the community with whom he has worked, produced a major milestone when the groundbreaking for the new courthouse took place. 
   Judge Coyle has had a distinguished career as an attorney and on the bench. Appointed to California's Eastern District bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1982, Judge Coyle has served as a judge for the Eastern District for 20 years, including 6 years as senior judge. Judge Coyle earned his law degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1956. He then worked for Fresno County as a Deputy District Attorney before going into private practice in 1958 with McCormick, Barstow, Sheppard, Coyle & Wayte, where he remained until his appointment by President Reagan. 
   Judge Coyle is very active in the community and has served in many judicial leadership positions, including: Chair of the Space and Security Committee; Chair of the Conference of the Chief District Judges of the Ninth Circuit; President of the Ninth Circuit District Judges Association; Member of the Board of Governors of the State Bar of California; and President of the Fresno County Bar. 
   My hope is that, in addition to serving the people of the Eastern District as a courthouse, this building will stand as a reminder to the community and people of California of the dedicated work of Judge Robert E. Coyle.

   Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today I wish to pay homage to Buck O'Neil a splendid athlete, a peerless ambassador of baseball, and a wonderful man who has become an American icon beloved by millions. 
   Many people first got to know Buck O'Neil as a major contributor to ``Baseball,'' Ken Burns's landmark documentary on our national pastime. While narrating the history of the Negro Leagues and the breaking of the color line in Major League Baseball, Buck passed along not only his prodigious knowledge of baseball and the society it helped to change forever but also his indomitable spirit, joy of living, and love of the game. 
   Before becoming a television star, Buck O'Neil was a baseball star in the Negro Leagues. As a first baseman and manager between 1937 and 1955, he played on nine championship teams and three East-West All Star teams, won a batting title, starred in two Negro Leagues World Series, and managed five pennant winners and five All Star teams. As manager of the Kansas City Monarchs, he mentored more than three dozen players who eventually made it to the Major Leagues. 
   In 1962, Buck O'Neil became the first African-American coach in the Major Leagues, where he helped the Chicago Cubs' Ernie Banks, Billy Williams, and Lou Brock develop the skills that led them to the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
   Today, at age 94, Buck is still bubbling over with enthusiasm for baseball, life, and his fellow human beings. He continues to serve on the Veterans' Committee at the Hall of Fame and as chairman of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City. 
   On May 6, 2006, the San Diego Padres will honor Buck O'Neil as part of their Third Annual Salute to the Negro Leagues. I am honored that this statement will be a part of that salute, and I send my great admiration and appreciation along to Buck O'Neil and all of the other great players of the Negro Leagues. 
   Mr. President, I know that you and all of our colleagues in the U.S. Senate will join me in sending our best wishes to Buck O'Neil for this very special day and for many more years of great service to baseball and the Nation.

   Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair and my friend from Delaware. 
   Mr. President, remember when Secretary Rumsfeld said he doubted the war would last 6 months, and when White House Budget Director Daniels said Iraq would be an affordable endeavor, and Condoleezza Rice used the imagery of a mushroom cloud to describe the threat of Iraq, and Vice President Cheney's now famous assessment of the insurgency: ``They are in their last throes, if you will''? That is a quote. 
   Well, this administration has failed to lead in Iraq in a way that is ensuring a way out of this with a successful mission. 
   Finally, the Senate is finding its voice today in both of these proposals in front of us. I am proud to say the Senate is standing up for a change in policy. The status quo is not working. In California, we have lost about 24 percent of the dead. We are suffering. Their families are suffering. Just to say, ``stay the course, stay the course, no matter how badly it is going,'' is simply not going to help our troops in the field. 
   So, Mr. President, I view this day as a very important breakthrough for the American people. They are being heard. The Democrats are hearing them. The Republicans took the very words of our resolution, made a couple of changes, I think important changes, which mitigate in favor of ours, but I certainly will be voting for both. 
   Thank you very much.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Inhofe and I have spoken about this amendment. As I said to him when he first decided to offer it, is there any question in anybody's mind that in America we speak English, that that is the language of the country? If you ask any person in this country, they will say English. If you ask any foreigner, they will say English. So the question is: Why do we have to say that English is the language that we speak in America? Are we that insecure about ourselves? Of course, it is. We are a nation of many who proudly keep their own culture. But, of course, English is our language. 
   If we have to say that it is your language, fine with me. Fine, I have no problem with it. In other words, if there are those who believe we have to now tell people what they already know, fine. But I want to do it in a way that unites us, not in a way that sets up some unintended consequences. Even though my friend from Oklahoma would not agree that there are unintended consequences, I think there are. For example, he said he made five speeches on the floor of the Senate in Spanish. And he went and he translated them so they appeared in English. Did he go over and did he dub in the videotapes? Because the videotapes will show the speech in Spanish. Is he breaking the rule then by not going up and hiring someone to dub in his words? What if there is an outbreak of a pandemic and it is moving quickly and there is no Federal law saying that you have to let people know in a series of different languages to protect our people and we didn't have time? 
   What if there is a terrorist attack, God forbid, and we are not even here, and we need to spread the word and there is no law, and we can't come in to pass a law. What is going to happen then? And as my friend from Vermont said: Are we going to have to take the State flags out from an exhibit in the basement because many of them have slogans in Latin? There are unintended consequences. 
   I know my friend tried hard to get us all to unify, but I have to say, if that  was what he wanted to do, Senator Salazar has put together an excellent amendment. English is the common and unifying language of the United States that helps provide unity for the people of the United States. That is a beautiful statement. It says that English is our common language. But he doesn't set up an issue in his amendment, which I have read very carefully, that can have the unintended consequence of coming back to bite us. His particular amendment unifies us. I thank the Senator for that very much, coming from a State that has great diversity, the great State of California. I thank him for his hard work. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to make some remarks to Senator Graham for a moment, if I could get his attention. I wanted to direct some remarks to the Senator. First, I wish to thank the Senator. I think what he is doing here is quite different than what we have been getting from this White House. The Senator is being very careful to essentially say, let's get together and work together to solve the problem. 
   I also believe that the word ``permanently'' is a little naive. I don't mind it, but the point is, nothing is permanent around here except we are going to die one day. We cannot bind future Congresses. I get the Senator's point that we want to make sure this challenge is met. Believe me, I intend to meet it. I intend to meet it without putting us in debt, and the Senator is totally silent on that; I appreciate that. This country is in debt now $7.7 trillion. This administration has turned it around. We started to balance the budget, pay back Social Security. It has been turned around. 
   We have the highest debt ever. A child born today has about $40,000 worth of debt on his or her back. This is painful for our country: $7.7 trillion of debt is $1 million a day for 21,000 years. That is what it is. I appreciate the fact that unlike the President's plan, the Senator from South Carolina does not talk about borrowing those staggering sums of money because there are a lot of us who will not do that to the American people. They are being burdened enough with this debt now. 
   The Senator is also silent on privatization. My hat is off to him on that because, as we know, the Democrats are saying, if you want to privatize this system, the only way you are going to do that is to put us deeper in debt, and you are going to take an overhead of one-half of 1 percent and turn it into a 20-percent overhead. That is according to a University of Chicago study. 
   I so appreciate that the Senator does not mention borrowing because we are staggering in red ink, and he does not mention privatization because it is a nonstarter. When you privatize, you take a guaranteed benefit and turn it into a guaranteed gamble. I have nothing against Wall Street, I once worked on Wall Street. I was a stockbroker. Sometimes it works out great, but you cannot count on it, not at all. So why would we take a system that has worked perfectly and turn it into a gamble, except if we really wanted to get some of that money away from the trust fund and into the hands of Wall Street. 
   I was in the House of Representatives in 1983, and I supported two icons in politics: Ronald Reagan, a Republican icon, and Tip O'Neill, a Democratic icon. They followed the spirit of the approach of Senator Graham, which 
   is we get together because, guess what. The people are more important than the politics. 
   We have a President who is doing his round of townhall meetings all across this great Nation. I think it is great. He is working hard to sell his privatization plan, to tell people they better listen to him or else they are going to be sorry. But do you know what the President did not count on? That the people understand what Social Security is. 
   So you can do a song and dance about privatization, you can talk about it in poetry, you can talk about an ownership society, but they are not fooled because this is what the people know: They pay a portion of their check over to the Social Security trust fund, and when they retire, they get a safety net retirement. It is safe, and it is sure. It has never defaulted. It is there. 
   And guess what. If the head of household dies and there are kids, they get a benefit. A lot of my constituents understand this. My own husband's father died when he was 10 years old. His mother had three kids. She was a stay-at-home mom. What would she do? Social Security. One of those kids, my husband's brother, was mentally disabled. What would she do? Social Security. 
   I praise my friend for not talking about putting this country into deeper debt--we are not going to go there--and for not mentioning privatization because we are not going to go there. We are not going to take money out of the trust fund and give it to Wall Street. We are not going to have a Social Security system that has an overhead cost one-half of 1 percent and turn it into a 20-percent overhead and turn it into a gamble. We are not going to do it. 
   The people are smart. They get it. I do not care how many townhall meetings any of us has, this is one the people understand. I have my own townhall meetings. The people get it, whether they are Republicans, Democrats, or Independents. They say Social Security works and why would we turn our back on it. 
   Watch out for the word ``reform.'' If it is truly reform, we should do it. But if it is repeal, which is what privatization is, we are not going to do it. 
   Again, with the same reservations that my friend has, I read this amendment and I say, bravo, we can talk, if we are not going to borrow. We can talk, if we are not going to privatize. We can talk, if we are not going to set up a two-tier system that hurts people. We can talk. And we can do what we did in the eighties. I was proud to stand with my President at that time, Ronald Reagan, and my Speaker at that time, Tip O'Neill, these icons who got behind a very simple plan. 
   And by the way, there are many civil ways. My friend has outlined one. We can step to the plate on this challenge. 
   Let's stop using the word ``crisis'' because you are not fooling anybody. Mr. President, 22 years ago the Cato Institute put out a paper. They said: Make people think it is a crisis as soon as you can. If they think it is a crisis, they may accept the end of Social Security. Tell them it is an iceberg coming. 
   That is what the White House secret little memo did.

   Mrs. BOXER. The people are smart. They know there are some people around here who have been trying to get rid of Social Security for decades. We cannot trust this matter to people who have wanted to do away with Social Security. The President himself said in 1978 that Social Security will go broke by 1988 unless it is privatized. He was wrong then; he is wrong now. He said in the year 2000 that people act as if Social Security is a Federal program or something. How do we trust someone who does not know Social Security is a Federal program where people pay their insurance, they pay for it, and they get back what they put in, plus a safety net? 
   I thank my colleague for yielding. I thank my friend, Senator Graham, for offering us something that I think many of us will be able to vote for.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee who did the hard work of exhaustively examining the nominee's record. They have done what the Constitution requires of us and the Founders intended--that Senators take seriously their role in giving advise and consent on members of the President's Cabinet. 
   The Attorney General is our Nation's chief law enforcement officer, tasked with upholding the Constitution and our laws. 
   While I believe Mr. Gonzales has a truly remarkable personal story, the poor judgment he has exercised in his role as White House Counsel has resulted in a serious consequences that cannot simply be overlooked when considering his nomination. 
   I will be voting against Mr. Gonzales for two main reasons. 
   First, Mr. Gonzales was the legal architect of the administration's policies on torture. 
   In 2002, when the intelligence community sought legal guidance about interrogation techniques, Mr. Gonzales asked the Justice Department to come up with legal justification for abusive interrogation tactics. The torture memo was drafted at his request and tacitly accepted by Mr. Gonzales. The Defense Department then used that memo to justify horrific and abusive interrogation tactics in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. 
   This memo sets forth a position so outlandish that even the Dean of Yale Law School has said that much of Saddam's Hussein's horrific abuses--like cutting off fingers, electrical shock, branding and burning of skin--would not meet the memo's definition of torture. 
   Mr. Gonzales has never clearly repudiated this memo even though it has been a stain on our law and national reputation. Mr. Gonzales was asked about this memo at his confirmation hearings before the Judiciary Committee. Senator LEAHY specifically asked him if he agreed with the memo's very narrow reading of the law about what constitutes torture. Mr. Gonzales replied: ``I don't recall today  whether or not I was in agreement with all of the analysis, but I don't have a disagreement with the conclusions then reached by the Department.'' Mr. Gonzales's response was completely unacceptable. 
   It was his acceptance of this memo that formed the basis of administration policy for 2 years until the Department of Justice repudiated it on December 30, 2004, 1 week before Mr. Gonzales's hearings. 
   Second, Mr. Gonzales played a central role in shaping the Bush administration's policy toward detainees. 
   He called the Geneva Conventions ``quaint'' and ``obsolete''. And he advised President Bush to deny prisoners the protections under the Geneva Conventions, which had been the unbroken practice of the United States for over 50 years, and which have protected our soldiers since 1949. 
   He did this over the objection of Secretary Powell and State Department legal counsel. They warned that this advice could undermine military culture, generate confusion about how to treat detainees, and ultimately lead to abuse. Tragically, this is exactly what happened. 
   The torture and other abuses of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan have done immeasurable damage to America's standing in the world, have undermined our military rules and traditions, and exposed our own soldiers and citizens to greater risks. 
   I cannot support a nominee who has done so much damage to America's fundamental values and moral leadership in the world, and has taken actions and positions that put our soldiers and citizens at greater risk.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Enzi says this debate is grating on the Republican side of the aisle. Sorry, that is how it is when you are on the wrong side of the truth. It is grating to have to hear the truth as Senator Kennedy and others have spoken of. 
   It has been 9 long years since there has been an increase in the minimum wage. It is a disgrace. While we see our friends on the other side fight for the CEOs of oil companies, in the Committee on Commerce, they would not even swear them in. They are all on that side. When it comes to working families, forget about it. 
   Then Senator Enzi implies this does not have anything to do with women. Women make up 59 percent of the workers who would be affected as a result of raising the minimum wage; 1.4 million working mothers would benefit directly, 760,000 single moms would get an immediate raise, and over 3 million kids have parents who would get an immediate raise. 
   What has happened to family values on the other side of the aisle? It seems to me it is just so many empty words. 
   Then they scare you and say the economy will suffer. All you have to do, again, is look at the facts and look at the truth. In the 4 years after the last minimum wage increase passed, the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades. All the talk about how bad a minimum wage increase is for the economy is not true. 
   I say to my Republican friends, support the Kennedy increase in the minimum wage. The truth shall set you free. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia. 
   I come to the Senate tonight with a tremendous sense of loss for the victims of the tragic war in Iraq. Yesterday, the military informed two California families that their sons were murdered in cold blood by the very same Iraqi troops they had been training. 
   Let me repeat that: The military informed two California families whose sons were in the National Guard that their sons were murdered in cold blood by the very same Iraqi troops they were training. 
   Sgt. Patrick McCaffrey and 1LT Andre Tyson were killed near Balad 2 years ago. After 2 long years, the Army is now telling the families that Iraqi troops who their sons had been training turned on them and intentionally killed them. 
   This morning, the mother of Sergeant McCaffrey appeared on CNN and said:  
   Patrick was never at ease and he constantly said, ``Mom, we're risking our life every day, all the time, permanently.''  
   She told the press that Patrick told his commanding officer twice that he was fired upon by Iraqi troops. He told his dad the same thing and his dad told the press that his commanding officer said, and I quote his dad: ``That he should keep his mouth shut.'' 
   Mrs. McCaffrey said she wants the story to come out because she believes there are other instances of Iraqi troops turning on our soldiers. This is a story that is all over the news. It is emblematic of 
   what this war is turning into. 
   This week, we all were devastated to hear of the cruel and savage killing of two United States soldiers who were reportedly tortured in a barbaric fashion. These soldiers were manning a traffic check point when they were captured by insurgents. A third soldier also died in the attack. 
   Every day we hear of a new tragedy from Iraq. Why? Because more than 3 years ago, our President launched a war that was based on false premises. The administration told the American people that Saddam posed an imminent threat to the United States because of his close ties to al-Qaida and because he had an active nuclear weapons program. The administration's case has unraveled in light of the facts. We have a chance tomorrow to stand up and say no to the status quo. We can do it with two Democratic amendments. We know there was no working relationship between al-Qaida and Saddam, and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program was dormant. 
   Just look at the State Department's own document which Senator Feingold talked about. It says clearly when we were attacked by al-Qaida on that fateful day of September 11, there was not one al-Qaida cell in Iraq. Yet those who asked questions about these false premises were dismissed, ridiculed, called unpatriotic, and, in one case, the case of Ambassador Joe Wilson, he actually faced retaliation. The wife of Ambassador Wilson had her identity as a CIA agent exposed. Why? Because Joe Wilson blew the whistle on President Bush's claim that Iraq had sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa. 
   Why do I recount Valerie Plame's story? Because it shows just how far the Bush administration and their Republican friends in Congress will go to tarnish and hurt those who see the war differently from them. That is frightening no matter what side of the fence you are on. Imagine going after someone's family because you felt you did not like what the man said. In fact, he told the truth, that there was no truth to the claim that Saddam was seeking yellow cake uranium. 
   In this debate right now, those same voices are saying that anyone who disagrees with the status quo in Iraq and speaks about an exit strategy for the war is advocating a policy of cut-and-run. Let me be clear, calling for redeployment of our troops out of Iraq is not cut-and-run. It is smart and strategic. 
   Why is it smart? Because it will give the signal to the Iraqis that they have to stand up and protect their own country. 
   Why is it strategic? Because it will allow us to use our resources to go after al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden. 
   Let's take a look at the status quo. The status quo in Iraq is an endless venture with ever-changing missions that has resulted in more than 2,500 United States deaths and 18,000 wounded. It is a blank check and a blind eye. 
   I have a chart that shows the costs. This is showing what this President calls ``progress'' and his Republican friends in Congress call progress. Let's look at the facts. The monthly cost of the Iraq war in 2003 was $4.4 billion a month. It is now $8 billion a month. It is causing our debt to soar. It is not being paid for in the usual way: It is put right on Uncle Sam's credit card and our grandchildren will pay the bill, maybe even their children. 
   The estimated number of insurgents in 2003, 3,000; estimated in 2006, 20,000. Is that progress in Iraq? I don't think so. 
   Insurgent attacks in 2003, 5 a day; now, 90 a day. Is that progress? I don't think so. 
   Incidents of sectarian violence, 5 per month; now it is 250 per month. 
   If that is progress, then we are in serious, serious trouble--more trouble than I think we are in. 
   How about Iraqis. Are they optimistic about the future? In 2003, 75 percent were optimistic. Do you know what the number is today? Thirty percent. These figures come from the Brookings Institution. 
   There are claims that the status quo is ``progress,'' when actually the status quo is a disaster. The war is taking a heavy toll on our fighting men and women, many of whom are serving their third tour of duty. Suicides are up. 
   In 2005, 83 United States Army soldiers committed suicide, an increase of 16 suicides over the 67 reported the year before, and the highest number since 90 were recorded in 1993. Of those 83 soldiers, 25 had been deployed to either Afghanistan or Iraq. 
   Divorces are up. Where are the family values around this place? Between 2001 and 2004, divorces among Active-Duty Army personnel have doubled. Divorces have doubled. That is the weight of this war. And post-traumatic stress disorder is rampant. A study published in the July 2004 New England Journal of Medicine revealed that 15 percent of marines and 17 percent of soldiers surveyed after deployment in Iraq ``met the screening criteria for major depression, generalized anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder.''  
   Our military men and women have done every single thing we have asked of them--even without a plan to anticipate the insurgency. Even without adequate body armor, even without enough up-armored humvees, here is what this administration has asked our fighting men and women to do: find the weapons of mass destruction, find Saddam Hussein and bring him to justice, find Saddam's family and bring them to justice, secure Iraq for elections--there have been three elections, successful, there--train Iraqi troops--there are now 260,000 of those Iraqi troops trained. 
   In light of all that our military has done--and they have paid the price in blood, in lost limbs, in pain and suffering and death--what are the Iraqi leaders saying? They have proposed amnesty for those who have killed American soldiers. The amnesty plan would include insurgents who have staged attacks against Americans--even as those attacks continue.

   Mrs. BOXER. It says: The premier is crafting a reconciliation program that ``doesn't rule out participation of `the bloody-handed people in the political process.''' 
   What happened when we brought up a resolution on this side of the aisle to say, no, no, we will not allow that to happen? What happened? The Republicans stalled us for 2, 3 days, figuring out a way they could get us to back down. But we did not back down. 
   I cannot believe it. They are still killing our soldiers, and the Republicans in the Senate are saying: Oh, give the Iraqi Government a chance. In their wisdom, they will do the right thing. Well, they are not doing the right thing when they are considering giving amnesty to those who are hurting, killing, brutalizing our troops. I cannot believe it. 
   And in light of all that I have laid out, what does our President say? He says: I will not allow us to leave until everything is absolutely perfect in Iraq. He does not know when that is. He is not even willing to talk about conditions that would be enough to bring our troops home. It is kind of like: Well, we will know it when we see it. Well, that is not enough for the American people. When the President said, ``mission accomplished,'' it was not true. And when he says now, we can make this work, we can have a country at peace, we can do all this, and we just have to stay there as long as it takes--blank check. Open checkbook, America. Open checkbook for  you. Debts on your children, debts on your grandchildren, and a blind eye to what is happening and what the Iraqi people want. 
   What kind of leadership is that? You think I like standing up here and getting into this kind of debate? No, I do not. But I have never seen anything like this since the Vietnam war, folks. I lived through those years. That was the reason I got into politics, so we would not make this mistake again. 
   Senate Democrats are providing real leadership. Do we all agree every inch of the way? No. But I predict to you, at the end of this vote, tomorrow, Republicans will be firm for the status quo, and Democrats will be for changing the mission, changing the dynamic. And that is going to be important for the American people to know. 
   As I said, redeploying our troops is smart and strategic, and here is why. Again, it is smart and strategic because the Iraqis must stand up to the job of providing security for their own people. My goodness, that is what countries do, folks. That is what countries do. We did it. Yes, we had people help us in the Revolution. By the way, France was one of those countries. But when the fighting was over, we had the boots on the ground. The Iraqi people have to stand up. They have to want democracy as much as we want it for them. 
   And I will tell you, we should start concentrating on the war against terror. My friends on the other side blend it all together. They blend it all together. But I have already proven to you there was not one al-Qaida cell in Iraq on 9/11. The State Department's own documents show it. There were more al-Qaida cells in America than there were in Iraq. But our presence there is fueling the insurgency completely. 
   Let me tell you what Peter Bergen has stated. He is an expert. He is an expert on terrorism. He has written books about it. He says this:  
   What we have done in Iraq is what bin Laden could not have hoped for in his wildest dreams: We invaded an oil rich Muslim nation in the heart of the Middle East, the very type of imperial adventure that bin Laden has long predicted was the United States' long term goal in the region. We deposed the secular socialist Saddam, whom bin Laden has long despised, ignited Sunni and Shia fundamentalist fervor in Iraq, and have now provoked a defensive jihad that has galvanized jihad minded Muslims around the world. 
   It's hard to imagine a set of policies better designed to sabotage the war on terrorism. 
   Now, I have spoken with many generals and military experts who agree that our long-term presence in Iraq is counterproductive. They tell us that our continued presence will continue to breed terrorists not only in Iraq but throughout the world. 
   Now, I want to show you, as I wind down this speech, how the Iraqi people now feel about our presence. The Brookings Institution revealed this poll. It was just printed in the press a few days ago. If this does not tell the story, nothing does. 
   Eighty-seven percent of the Iraqis support a timeline for U.S. redeployment. Eighty-seven percent of the Iraqi people want us out of there and want a timeline specifically. By the way, this is one thing that unites all the groups there. Sixty-four percent of the Kurds want a timeline for U.S. redeployment. Ninety percent of the Shias want a timeline for U.S. redeployment. Ninety-four percent of the Sunnis want a timeline for U.S. redeployment. 
   So you tell me how it makes sense, at a time when we are learning that the Iraqis, whom we are training, have, in at least two cases we know about, turned against our soldiers, who are risking their lives--shot them in cold blood. For what? They are there to help the Iraqi people, and they are being killed. 
   I have to say that the status quo is leading us deeper and deeper into a place we don't want to be as a country. The American people want an exit strategy. An exit strategy is not cut-and-run; it is smart and strategic. The status quo is more of the same. How many more times will we come down here and talk about beheadings? How many more times will we come down? How many more deaths will it take until finally we say enough is enough? 
   That time, I hope, is coming. I think we are going to see votes on these two Democratic amendments that, when taken together, will indicate a real difference here between the parties. 
   Listen to what the Iraqi people are saying. Listen to what the American people are saying. Listen to what the world is saying. The views of the United States by people all over the world are going down. In the last year alone, favorable views of the United States dropped in Spain, from 41 percent to 23 percent approval; in Indonesia, from 38 percent down to 30 percent; in Turkey, from 23 percent to 12 percent; and in India--India is considered one of our best friends--it has gone from 71 percent down to 56 percent. This does not make us stronger in the world; it makes us weaker. This does not make us safer in the world; it makes us more vulnerable. 
   I believe in democracy. So let us look at what the Iraqi people are telling us they want. They want a timeline and want us out. Let's listen to the generals who have told us that our long-term presence is fueling the insurgency and we need to get out. Let's listen to the American people who are wise and love our troops and say it is time for an exit strategy. 
   Folks, we are paralyzed. We are paralyzed here. It is like we are in a hole and we can't get out. Well, I say today is the day to start climbing out of that hole. Senate Democrats have proposed two ways to change the dynamics here in this war. 
   I plan to vote aye for the Kerry-Feingold-Boxer amendment. It speaks to me as something that will work for us. It is strategic. It is wise. It is smart. I will also vote for the Levin amendment because it moves us in the right direction. It shakes up the mission into something that makes sense. It changes the mission. It starts bringing our troops home and starts to redeploy them. 
   So my feeling is, the status quo is a disaster. It is a disaster. Let us open our eyes to the truth. Can you imagine how I felt when I got a call in my office by a woman who couldn't find out the truth about who killed her son? And the military had completed its investigation, and they knew her son was killed by the very same Iraqi soldiers whom he was training. And they kept it a secret? They kept it a secret until today from that woman. I have to say, why? Is it because they are fearful that when the American people learn of this, the support for this war will plummet even further? I don't know the answer to that question. But so far, I have no good answers. It worried me with Mr. Tillman, Patrick Tillman, in Afghanistan, when they said he was killed by the enemy, and the parents pressed on and pressed on, and it turned out to be friendly fire. 
   I am telling you, my colleagues, this is a turning point for us as individual Senators. I hope we have the courage to say no to the status quo, support the Kerry-Feingold-Boxer alternative, and also support the Levin alternative because they both shake it up and say, once and for all, we need to talk about an exit strategy. In the end, that is going to be the road for success. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will rebut something that my friend from Virginia, Senator Allen, said about Janice Rogers Brown. He said she was in the mainstream. This is a woman who has served on the California Supreme Court that is made up of six Republicans and one Democrat. She has dissented a third of the time because her Republican friends on that court are not radical enough for her. Thirty-one times she stood alone on the side of a rapist, on the side of energy companies against the consumers, against women who were seeking to get contraception. It goes on and on--against workers. She said it was fine for Latinos to have racial slurs used against them in the workplace. 
   This is a woman with an inspiring personal life story. But it is what she has done to other people's lives that makes her far out of the mainstream. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am opposed to and will vote against the Central America Free Trade Agreement, CAFTA. 
   I am not against trade agreements, provided they are fair. But when those agreements unfairly disadvantage American workers and businesses, I oppose them. 
   I could vote for CAFTA if it meant more jobs in America and a stronger American economy. But, I do not believe that is the case. Because of CAFTA, Americans will lose jobs and manufacturing will move overseas. 
   CAFTA will not foster free trade; it will result in unfair competition. Most of the Central American governments are notoriously lax in enforcing their labor laws. Under CAFTA, the Central American countries pledge to enforce their labor laws and strive to ensure workers' rights are protected, but these are merely ``paper pledges.'' Moreover, unlike other trade agreements, the mechanisms for forcing the Central American governments to enforce their own labor laws are limited and the penalties for noncompliance are negligible. Worse still, nothing in CAFTA prohibits a country from further relaxing its existing laws. 
   In addition, most Central American countries do not have strong environmental protection laws, and enforcement of the laws that do exist is limited. Companies are permitted to destroy the environment and harm their workers in order to produce cheaper products for export. 
   U.S. manufacturers and workers are the best in the world. Their productivity and innovation cannot be matched. But even they cannot--nor should they have to--compete with foreign companies that have weak labor protections and that ignore the environment in order to cut prices. 
   After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that CAFTA will result in American workers losing their jobs, U.S. companies closing their doors, a downward pressure on wages, and a worsening trade deficit. 
   For these reasons, I cannot support CAFTA and will vote against it.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feingold for his leadership. I also thank Senator McCain. They have two amendments before us, the next one coming shortly. I enthusiastically support this amendment. I think this one is very much a reform. I strongly oppose the other one. But I am not going to use my time now to talk about the second amendment because I do want to concentrate on what an important step forward this particular amendment is.  
   The 2005 hurricane season taught us many valuable lessons--lessons that we will never forget because we saw them with our very own eyes. And one of the most important lessons is that major water resources projects and especially flood control projects must be carefully reviewed to be sure they will be effective. 
   What a disaster it is for our taxpayers to spend millions and billions on these projects, only to learn that they were not designed well or they didn't meet the real threat that was posed by Mother Nature or that there was cronyism dealing with putting together the alternatives. 
   I believe this amendment will put independent and expert eyes on the data, on the science, and on the engineering of our major public works projects. We need these independent and expert eyes because so much is at stake. 
   I come from a State that has every kind of natural disaster imaginable. The people there are very good at pointing out what the problems are, and we have to be equally as good in responding to these needs and making sure we give them quality, that we give them the protection they deserve. 
   In this amendment, we are giving the people what they deserve. When a review is triggered under this proposal, a panel of experts, of engineers and hydrologists to biologists and economists, must look at the underlying technical data and look at the project in its whole and make sure that the project will meet and achieve its goals. 
   There is little point in expending hard-earned taxpayers' dollars unless we know it is being spent right. What this particular amendment does is bring in those outside experts to kind of give a seal of approval on what we are doing. 
   Again, I don't go along with the next amendment, and I will be back to talk about that, but this amendment does what needs to be done. The panel will make recommendations to improve the project. This particular amendment is common sense, pure and simple. 
   Complex and costly engineering projects deserve the additional scrutiny. Mistakes do happen. You know what. Mistakes will happen no matter how many panels we have, but the idea is to cut down on those mistakes. We are all human. We all make mistakes, but how much better is it to get a very seasoned pair of eyes to take a look at what we are doing. 
   I believe this amendment will make these projects safer, and they will make them more effective. 
   I support the Army Corps of Engineers' mission. When I first got into politics in local government, I worked very closely with the Corps on many flood control projects. We have had our arguments, we have had our debates, but over the years, we have managed to work well together. But there were moments during those debates when I knew I could benefit from outside experts, and that is what we are giving to the Congress and, therefore, to the American people. We are going to have additional scrutiny, and we are going to make sure that mistakes are rare. 
   When we talk about mistakes, it is one thing to make a mistake on an issue that doesn't put lives at risk, but we are talking about the protection of life and limb for our people. 
   I think this amendment will help the Corps do its job better. It will improve public faith in the work of the Corps because, frankly, after Katrina, many people are saying to me: Can we trust these public works projects, these flood control projects to really protect us? 
   They have doubts, and they should have doubts, having seen what they saw. 
   I, again, thank Senators Feingold and McCain for their leadership on this particular amendment, and I urge a ``yes'' vote. I know it is going to be a close vote, but I really do believe people listening to this debate will see that all we are saying in support of this amendment is we are bringing in outside experts to keep an eye on taxpayers' dollars and keep an eye on these designs to make sure that when we fund a public works project, we have done everything in our power to make sure it is designed well, that it will be cost-effective, and it will be safe.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my chairman, Chairman Inhofe, for granting me this time. 
   I feel so strongly against this amendment. I really need the time to explain to my good colleagues why I think it ought to be voted down. 
   We have amendments before us from time to time and they come to us as reform. I totally understand that we need reform in this whole area of the way we prioritize projects that come before us. But I don't believe this is reform at all. In my view, I think this is a delegation of the responsibility of the Senate and the House over to the executive branch. I believe it is going to be put into the hands of people who won't know a thing about this subject matter, and it is going to bring politics right into this Chamber. We were elected by the people. The cities and counties count on us to do our homework, to do our due diligence and understand what the needs are of our people, what our flood control needs are in our States, what our other needs are in our States, the studies that need to be performed, and all of that. That is our job. 
   The McCain amendment just simply wraps it all up and tosses it over to the executive branch. It sets up a whole new bureaucracy that I think is absolutely unnecessary and, frankly, I think it is disastrous for this WRDA bill. Unlike the other amendment which we supported, which is peer review, that looked forward, this amendment looks back into this bill where we have sat for years and years. 
   Again, I thank Senators INHOFE, JEFFORDS, BOND, and BAUCUS and the leaders of this committee who have worked with us to ferret out the projects that didn't have merit. I can attest to the fact that I had an amendment that I wanted to move forward. 
   I was persuaded by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that there was a better way to move forward. 
   We have done our work. This amendment is well intended. I know that. I know the people who have put it forward to us have good intentions. But I think it is going to make it more difficult for worthy projects to get needed funding. That includes projects that have an impact on public health and safety. 
   I may have a debate with Senator Bond over which project I think is the more worthy and we will sit and talk about it and we will argue about it. At the end of the day, there will be a decision. Why should the two of us toss that all over to the executive branch, no matter who is President? What does it have to do with them? It is our bill. The President has the right to veto it if he doesn't like it or sign it. But thrashing out what ought to be in it and what is good, we have done that. That is part of our job. 
   There is another problem with this amendment. It sets up a nightmare of a tier system. You have to fight your way into a tier in order to be funded. The administration--this one and the next one and the one thereafter--will be able to recommend which tier your State projects ought to be in. When the first tier reaches $5 billion, or when there are 100 projects in it, that tier is finished. So if you have a very important project, a large project, but let's say we all know we have to move to help the folks who are impacted by Hurricane Katrina, and they have priority--we all agree that it has a very high priority--if you represent a large State, you have a large project, you will never make it into the first tier. It is bad for my State. 
   Frankly, it is bad for any project that is large enough and can't get into the first tier--it gets knocked down. 
   You get stuck in a lower tier simply because the project may protect more people. How does that make any sense whatsoever? It is an arbitrary system. It can label a project as second tier despite critical local public safety needs. It will undermine a project's chances of receiving appropriations. 
   We already know what a fight we have to convince our colleagues in the Committee on Appropriations that the projects in our State have merit. We subject these projects to tremendous scrutiny, first in this particular WRDA bill. As we struggle to get appropriations funds, we have to make the case. Then we have to go to conference and continue to make the case. 
   Under this amendment, I am sorry to say this is no reform. I ask rhetorically if this makes any sense. There is a very important committee that has been set up in the underlying bill. The committee has some very important functions, but now the McCain amendment adds this next function on to this committee, this coordinating committee which, by the way, is going to hire an executive director. 
   If anyone wants to learn how projects and laws get bogged down, here is an example. This committee that is going to be set up includes the following people: The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Development, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator of the EPA, the chairperson of the Council on Environmental Quality, and here is my favorite, the Secretary of Homeland Security. 
   We all know about their priority list. We just took a look at their priority list. Petting zoos should be protected before bridges and highways. They have included Old McDonald's Petting Zoo, a bourbon festival, a bean festival, the Kangaroo Conservation Center. This is what the Department of Homeland Security said ought to be prioritized. 
   Do we want to invite them into a new prioritization game for the WRDA projects? I hope not. What could come out of this is not good. 
   In discussing this with my colleagues, they say: But, Senator Boxer, they are just going to recommend. We have the ability to sit down among ourselves--Democrats and Republicans--as we have done in this bill, and come to some decisions on what the priorities are. I believe the Committee on Appropriations, working with all of us, has a second bite at that apple. 
   I don't believe we need to ask this President or any future President to get into this issue and convene meetings, have studies, and waste money just to put together a list that they say is their priorities. What makes their priorities better than our priorities? They are not even elected. This is not even their job. How do you come forward--I ask my friend from Arizona, rhetorically, because he is not here--giving people who have no idea what this is about the power over the projects? They say it is just a recommendation, but we know they will take that seriously. 
   We remember the whole tizzy when they said they thought it was fine for the country of Dubai to run our ports. There was a big debate in the Senate. Most Members believed that was a mistake. That also came out of some committee. 
   We all fight to get here. We all work hard to get here. At a minimum, we are in touch with our States and we know the needs of our States. The Congress, not a political appointee, not some bureaucrat, but Members of the Senate should retain the central responsibility for establishing the border resource priorities for their States. Instead, this amendment leaves the recommendation of priorities up to a committee made up of Cabinet and other political appointees. 
   We are inviting politics into this debate. As Senator Inhofe said, this is one of those rare moments in history, this bill, where politics is left at the committee door. We worked together. We worked hard together. Now, with this McCain amendment, we are injecting partisan politics. In this case it is a Republican President. In future years it could be a Democratic President. It does not make any difference. 
   We should do our job. We should not punt the ball elsewhere. What are we here for? Anyone who votes for this, and I am sure there will be a few--I hope not too many--the message they are basically sending is that they do  not feel comfortable enough, they do not feel knowledgeable enough, they do not feel strong enough to stand up for what needs to be done in their States. 
   Again, I ask, do we really want to have the Department of Homeland Security deciding the critical water resource projects? They have enough to do to get their own priorities in order. 
   With all due respect to members of the Cabinet, we as individual Senators know our States' needs. We know our States' priorities. This is not reform; this is injecting, in my view, partisanship into a very bipartisan approach. 
   I trust my colleagues, whether Republican or Democrat, in this bill because they have to explain why their projects are worthy. This is not like an earmark where something is stuck in the bill in the middle of the night. This is a major reauthorization bill where every project is looked at very carefully. I don't believe any Cabinet is going to be more effective at telling us what projects should be funded. 
   As Members of Congress, let us not surrender our responsibility to an executive branch that, in my view, will not reflect the real needs of our people. I urge my colleagues to vote no, a very sound no, on this amendment. Let's send a message today that this Senate knows what it is doing in this bill. 
   I feel very comfortable with the leadership of Senators INHOFE and JEFFORDS, that we do know what we are doing in this bill. If you are for this bill, I hope you will vote no on the McCain amendment. 
   I give the remainder of my time to the good Senator, Mr. Inhofe. I thank him so much for the chance to speak against this amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss an amendment that I understand Mr. WARNER and Mr. LEVIN have included in the managers' package. 
   I would like to begin by thanking Senators WARNER and LEVIN and their staffs for working so hard with us to get this done. I would also like to thank my colleague Senator LIEBERMAN for working diligently with me to draft this legislation. 
   He really is a true champion for our men and women in uniform. 
   This amendment addresses an issue that is vitally important to many of my colleagues here in the Senate--improving mental health screening and services for our brave men and women serving in our armed services. 
   As we all know, our soldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors have been bogged down in an extremely dangerous and increasingly destructive war in Iraq for more than 3 years, and the pressure is taking its toll. 
   Multiple deployments, the insurgency, and the unprecedented urban combat that many of our service members face is resulting in high levels of mental illness, including PTSD--a disorder that, if left untreated, can cripple a person for life. 
   Tragically, many of our service members are not being adequately screened and treated for these conditions. 
   Let me give you an example from last month's Hartford Courant, which ran an extended series of articles detailing the failures of our military health care system. 
   Nine months ago, 27-year-old SSG Bryce Syverson was on suicide watch and taking antidepressants in the psychiatric unit at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Doctors had diagnosed him with PTSD and depression, which they attributed to his 15-month tour in Iraq as a gunner on a Bradley tank. 
   Today, Staff Sergeant Syverson is back in the combat zone as part of a quick reaction force in Kuwait that could be summoned to Iraq at any time. 
   He got his deployment orders after being told he wasn't fit for duty. 
   He got his gun back after being told he was too unstable to carry a weapon. 
   In a recent e-mai1 to his parents and brothers, Sergeant Syverson wrote: ``Nearly died on a PT test out here on a nice and really mild night because of the medication that I am taking. Head about to explode from the blood swelling inside, the [lightening] storm that happened in my head, the blurred vision, confusion, dizziness and a whole lot more. Not the best feeling in the entire world to have after being here for two days....... And I ask myself what ..... am I doing here?'' 
   I ask my colleagues, do this make any sense? 
   In the Hartford Courant's May 17 piece entitled ``Still Suffering, But Redeployed,'' COL Elspeth Ritchie, a psychiatry consultant to the Army surgeon general, acknowledged that the decision to deploy soldiers with PTSD is a matter that the Army is currently wresting with. 
   I would like to quote Colonel Ritchie, because I think that something she said is particularly telling: ``historically, we have not wanted to send soldiers or anybody with post-traumatic stress disorder back into what traumatized them..... . The challenge for us ..... is that the Army has a mission to fight.'' 
   I appreciate that the military--particularly the Army--is facing severe manpower needs, but the fact that we are knowingly sending U.S. service members back into the very situation that caused their trauma is utterly tragic. 
   Tragic and unacceptable. 
   The Boxer-Lieberman amendment would do some very important things to address this situation. 
   First, it would improve mental health screening procedures for those about to be deployed. Currently, the military's pre-deployment mental health assessment is a single question on a form. 
   The Boxer-Lieberman amendment requires an enhanced mental health screening process prior to deployment that would include: a mental health history of the servicemember; current mental health treatment or use of medications for a mental health disorder; an assessment of any behavior identified by the unit commander that might provided by the member, (through a checklist or other means,) of symptoms that might indicate a mental health condition. 
   Second, the amendment mandates that soldiers determined to have symptoms of a mental health condition--either before deployment or after deployment--will be referred to a qualified health care professional with experience in the evaluation and diagnosis of mental health conditions. 
   This is an area where we are really falling short-the Hartford Courant reports that military screeners have arranged mental health evaluations for fewer than one in 300 deploying troops. 
   Third, the Boxer-Lieberman amendment mandates that any member of the Armed Forces who requests access to mental health care services, before, during, or after deployment to a combat zone, will be given access within 72 hours after making the request or as soon as possible. 
   Fourth, the amendment directs the Department of Defense to develop clear and consistent guidelines and regulations on what mental health conditions and psychotropic drugs ought to prevent a servicemember from being deployed to a combat zone. 
   It also requires the Department to develop guidelines for the deployability and treatment of service members diagnosed with severe mental illness or PTSD. 
   And lastly, it will require the Department to develop a plan to monitor individuals deployed to a combat zone who are known to have a mental health condition or disorder or are known to be taking psychotropic medications. 
   I think that these are small steps that we can take to ensure that our service members receive a higher standard of mental health services and care. 
   I hope it will also prevent stories like the one I am about to tell you, again in the Hartford Courant, from happening again. 
   Patricia Powers of Skiatook, OK wonders why her 20-year-old son Joshua was sent to Iraq barely six months after he enlisted in the Army. 
   According to Ms. Powers, she ''just couldn't believe'' that the Army took her son in, as her son had Asperger's syndrome--a form of autism.  
   People with Asperger syndrome tend to be highly intelligent, but they have trouble in social settings and are quite often loners who have difficulty building relationships. 
   However, Asperger's was not the only neurological issue facing Joshua. 
   In reading through the medical records of her son's frequent visits to the base doctor, Ms. Powers found that in every instance, the doctor had taken note of Joshua's severe depression. 
   Three weeks after arriving in Iraq, Pvt. Powers left his barracks around midnight and walked to the latrine, where he ended his life with a gunshot to the head. 
   In a recent GAG report, the GAG noted that the military has been reluctantto create uniform guidelines for deployment. 
   In its recommendation, the GAG argued that guidelines are necessary ``so that in future deployments [the Defense Department] would not experience situations such as those that occurred with members being deployed into Iraq who clearly had pre-existing conditions that should have prevented their deployment.'' 
   Situations like Joshua Power's Situations like Bryce Syverson's, where he was forced to ask his family: ``What am I doing here?'' 
   Mr. President, the heroic men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are doing a fantastic job. 
   In Iraq, they have succeeded in every mission that has been asked of them, even the ones that have changed over time. In Afghanistan, they are relentlessly hunting for the man responsible for the deaths of over 3,000 Americans. But as the death toll continues to rise, so does strain. 
   Ided today just two examples of soldiers who clearly indicated that deploying them to a combat zone would be a mistake. But we know that there are many more. 
   What we are asking for in this amendment is simple: that the Pentagon does a better job of dealing with mental health matters for the men and women that it sends into harm's way. I don't think this is too much to ask. 
   Again, I like to thank Senator WARNER, Senator LEVIN, and Senator LIEBERMAN for their support.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to discuss an amendment that I understand Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN have included in the managers' package. 
   This amendment--that I worked on with my colleague Senator SNOWE--would move toward expanding eligibility for the Purple Heart to all prisoners of war who die in captivity regardless of the cause of death. 
   The need for this important amendment was brought to my attention by a group of Korean War veterans--the Tiger Survivors--who identified what many of my colleagues agree is a glaring loophole in current law. 
   You may be surprised to learn that currently, only prisoners of war who die during their imprisonment of wounds inflicted by the enemy--such as a gunshot wound or intentional poisoning--clearly meet the criteria for posthumous Purple Heart recognition. 
   Those who die of starvation, disease, or other causes during captivity do not. I would like to give you an example of what I mean by recounting the story of the crew members who survived the sinking of the USS Houston, a Navy cruiser that was sunk by the Japanese off the coast of Java in February 1942. 
   After swimming to shore, the Japanese transported American POWs to Burma to work as slave labor building the Burma-Thai Railway, which would stretch 250 miles between mountains, across rivers, and through jungles. 
   These American POWs cut down trees, built road beds and bridges, and laid ties and rails for what is known as the Death Railway. 
   Conditions for these Americans were appalling. Each man received half a cup of bug-infested rice a day, and some POWs dropped below 80 pounds. Malnutrition brought on diseases like beri beri, pellagra, and scurvy--severe vitamin deficiencies that result in horrible suffering and even death. 
   The tropical environment also bred cases of dysentery, malaria, cholera, and tropical ulcers that ate through flesh to expose bone. 
   Although Japanese doctors were present in the camps, they were not allowed any drugs or tools for practicing medicine. Those workers who were too slow were beaten; those who were too sick to work received no food, and were eventually sent off to die. 
   Under current law, many of these individuals would not be eligible for the Purple Heart. 
   Doesn't it make sense that our young service members who died in this manner would be recognized as having died at the hands of the enemy? 
   Doesn't it make sense that the Houston crew members who were denied treatment and died of starvation and disease in captivity would be eligible for the Purple Heart? 
   Language that would correct this injustice was accepted as part of the House version of the Defense authorization bill, where it had the overwhelming bipartisan support of 216 cosponsors. 
   Equally important, correcting this important loophole in the law has been endorsed by the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Military Order of the Purple Heart, the National Association for Uniformed Services, the Military Officers of America Association, the Korean War Veterans Association, National League of POW-MIA Families, Tiger Survivors, and a number of other prominent veterans organizations. 
   I can think of no stronger endorsement than from these fine groups who know first-hand the suffering of war. 
   I would like to tell you one more story by a World War II soldier by the name of John Coleman. This is his story as recounted in his book, Bataan and Beyond:  
   The treatment of the death march and imprisonment ..... is beyond the imagination's ability to comprehend. If there ever was a hell on earth, this was administered to the 7,000 souls of some of the bravest and most devoted of our military personnel. Day after day they were in agony, seemingly blotted out in memory by their nation. They suffered under the burning tropical sun, on starvation rations, with little water to drink. They could not even wash the filth from their bodies or clothes, matted hair, and beards. They were mentally depressed, had swollen limbs from beri beri, unhealed festered wounds that were never treated. They also had distended stomachs, bloody dysentery, and raw, sore mouths from pellagra. Even a drink of water would cause their mouths to burn. Everyone had stomach worms that would sometimes find their way out of the body through the nose. No attempt was made by the Imperial Japanese Army to furnish any kind of medication to alleviate the suffering. 
   Unimaginable. Simply unimaginable. 
   Mr. President, these brave members of the Armed Forces suffered these cruelties so that we might enjoy the freedoms we have today. I can think of no more fitting tribute for their sacrifice than to posthumously make them eligible for the Purple Heart. 
   While the amendment that I originally offered would have provided congressional authorization expanding eligibility for the Purple Heart, I worked with Senators WARNER and LEVIN on compromise language that would require the President to determine whether eligibility for the Purple Heart should be expanded to all POW's who died in captivity. 
   I sincerely hope the President will take a serious look at this proposal, and ensure that our POWs are afforded the recognition they deserve.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose this budget and will vote against it. All of my colleagues should. It sets the wrong priorities. It breaks promises to the American people. And it is the height of fiscal irresponsibility. 
   Let me begin with the priorities. The priorities of the American people are not the priorities of this budget. 
   It is quite clear what the priorities of this budget are: tax cuts for the wealthy. In just one year, this budget provides a tax cut for millionaires totaling $32 billion. 
   Meanwhile, education funding is cut almost $1 billion below the services we are providing now. A total of 48 education programs are eliminated. The promise that was made in the No Child Left Behind Act is broken by $12 billion. We should be increasing our commitment to our children, not cutting it. 
   Veterans programs--for those brave men and women who served our country and are currently serving our country in Iraq and Afghanistan--are cut $500 million. As more and more veterans return to this country, the demands on the VA system will only grow. This budget ignores them. 
   This budget provides no funding for additional police officers on the street, and two major programs to help local law enforcement are eliminated. 
   Medicaid--the health care program for the poor and disabled, a large portion of whom are children--is cut $10 billion. 
   Funding for the Centers for Disease Control--to prevent diseases and to fight outbreaks--is cut 9 percent. 
   The promise we made to our farmers in 2002 is broken with cuts of $3 billion. 
   What is going on here? Our children, our veterans, the safety of our streets, and the health of our people--all are taking a back seat to tax cuts for millionaires. This budget helps the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans at the expense of 99 percent of Americans. 
   You would think that with all of these cuts in spending for important programs, at least the budget would be balanced--or at least would be more fiscally responsible than it has been in the past 4 years. 
   You would be wrong. This budget increases our debt by $3.1 trillion over the next 5 years. In 2010, the Federal debt will be over $11 trillion. 
   That figure is so high, it is nearly incomprehensible. So let me put it another way: $11 trillion is $1 million every day for 30,000 years.  
   And 11 trillion in debt is not the whole story. This budget does not include the almost $400 billion in costs for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This budget does not include over $700 billion in costs for the President's plan to privatize Social Security. This budget does not inc1ude over $700 billion to ensure that middle-class Americans are not hit with the alternative minimum tax. 
   Why aren't these included? Because it would mean even more debt. Debt upon debt upon debt upon debt. And most of it owed to those from foreign countries. We are borrowing from the Japanese, the Chinese, the British, and others--and sticking the bill to our children and grandchildren. 
   And speaking of the President's plan to privatize Social Security, I find it ironic that the President again tonight tried to scare the American people by saying that Social Security was going ``bankrupt,'' when at the same time, this budget steals $2.5 trillion over 10 years from the Social Security Trust Fund. Instead of tax cuts for millionaires, we should be paying back the Trust Fund. 
   Finally, this budget sets the stage for opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. It has nothing to do with the budget. It has nothing to do with increasing our energy independence. It has everything to do with destroying one of America's most environmentally pristine areas. 
   This budget has the wrong priorities, bankrupts our country, and destroys our environment. It should be soundly and overwhelmingly rejected.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor Senator Feinstein's amendment to provide Governors with veto authority on the siting of onshore liquified natural gas, LNG, facilities. This is an extremely important issue in California, and I commend my colleague for her amendment. 
   The energy bill we are debating hands full authority for LNG siting decisions to a federal entity, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC. It denies States a role in deciding whether and where LNG terminals may be located on our coastlines. 
   This is a misguided proposal. 
   Does FERC have a better understanding than a State's Governor of the potential environmental impact of an LNG facility located on or near the State's shore? Does FERC better understand the potential safety risk of facilities located near residential areas? Is FERC better qualified than a State to judge whether a proposed LNG facility would pose an unacceptable security risk to the area? Can FERC make a better judgment than the Governor of a State as to whether the benefits of an LNG facility will outweigh the drawbacks? 
   The answer to all of these questions is ``no.'' Only individual States can determine the best solution for their citizens when so much is at stake in terms of safety, security, and the sanctity of our environment. 
   We in California are all too aware that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's decisions may not be in our best interests. For too long during California's energy crisis in 2000-2001, FERC ignored the problem and took no action to help. Even today, four years later, we are still waiting for FERC to order refunds on the unjust and unreasonable rates charged by energy companies that were manipulating the market. We in California do not trust FERC to protect our interests. 
   I recognize that this country has a growing need for natural gas resources, and the construction of LNG facilities will help meet that need in the years to come. I am not arguing that no LNG terminals should be constructed on or close to our shores. I am simply arguing that FERC should not be the final arbiter in determining where those facilities are located. Each State deserves to decide for itself whether the benefits of such a facility outweigh the costs. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, our Nation is faced with the threat of global climate change that could fundamentally alter all of our lives and the lives of our children. California has a great deal to lose if we do not take steps to halt and reverse climate change. My State enjoys tremendous ecological diversity ranging from our cool and wet redwood forests of the north coast, to the hot Mojave and Colorado deserts in the southeast, to the vast and fertile agricultural stretches in the central valley. Climate change is a very real threat to those natural ecosystems. 
   Scientific predictions indicate that human-induced global warming may  produce a 3- to 10-degree rise in temperature over the next 97 years. That may not initially sound dramatic. But it would be enough to change the timing and amount of precipitation in my State. This could, for instance, lead to decreased summer stream flows, which would intensify the already significant controversy over the allocation of water for urban, agricultural and environmental needs. 
   Scientists also predict that by the year 2050, California will face higher average temperatures every month of the year in every part of the State. The average temperature in June in the Sierra Nevada Mountains could increase by 11 degrees Fahrenheit. The snow pack in the Sierra, which is a vital source of water in the State, is expected to drop by 13 feet and to have melted entirely nearly 2 months earlier than it does now. This could reduce the amount of precious water on which we now rely for agriculture, drinking water and other purposes. 
   The solution to the climate change problem is to first reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this regard, the McCain-Lieberman amendment would be a meaningful step in the right direction. It would create an innovative cap and trade system to reduce emissions. In 2010, the system would cap greenhouse gas emissions at the level that was released in the year 2000. It would then allow facilities to buy or sell credits that would allow for greenhouse gas emissions but within the overall cap. This could efficiently reduce overall levels of emissions while allowing flexibility for certain industries. 
   The second step in solving the climate change problem is to increase the use of renewable resources, such as wind and solar. Unfortunately, this is where the McCain-Lieberman amendment doesn't just fall short, but would be a step backwards. The amendment includes provisions to provide financial assistance to so-called ``clean'' technologies. On its face, it sounds good. But, the amendment makes nuclear power eligible for these subsidies. 
   Here we go again. The nuclear industry is once again knocking on Uncle Sam's door asking for Federal subsidies to pad their bottom line. We should oppose the nuclear industry's latest effort to raid the public purse. Nuclear power is not the solution to climate change, and it is not ``clean.'' The nuclear industry has not solved its waste and safety problems. By subsidizing the creation of new nuclear plants, we are condoning the creation of more waste and turning a blind eye to the hazards associated with nuclear power. 
   Proponents of these subsidies say that they are not limited to nuclear power, and that many types of zero or low-emission technologies could benefit. However, the amendment creates an unfair playing field for this assistance by side-stepping the costs of nuclear power's waste and safety problems. A candid analysis of energy choices must consider the full life-cycle costs associated with each technology. This amendment fails to contain such an analysis. Thus, the amendment unfairly and irresponsibly ignores nuclear power's biggest problem--the waste. This could easily tip the scales in favor of more subsidies for nuclear plants, and less for other truly renewable technologies. 
   The nuclear industry has already benefited from $145 billion in Federal subsidies over the last 50 years. Truly clean and renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar, have received just $5 billion. 
   Moreover, these new subsidies could go to some of the world's biggest companies. The Top-10 nuclear energy producing corporations in the Nation are among the largest companies in the world. These companies include Duke Energy, Exelon and Dominion Resources, which are among the 200 largest companies in the world. 
   Do these large companies need Federal subsidies? No. These ten corporations earned more than $10 billion in profits in 2004 selling energy from a variety of sources. 
   Subsidies for new nuclear plants are not a sound investment. The Federal Energy Information Administration and a representative of the nuclear industry both acknowledge that nuclear plants are not a viable technology without new subsidies. The EIA has stated that between 2003 and 2025, ``new nuclear power plants are not expected to be economical.'' Thomas Capps, the Chief Executive Officer of Dominion Resources--which has more than $55 billion in assets--was asked about the economics of constructing new nuclear plants. He said, ``I am all for nuclear power--as long as Dominion doesn't have to take the risk .....'' Instead of the nuclear industry taking the risk, the nuclear industry wants the public to shoulder the burden. 
   New subsidies for new nuclear plants are unnecessary. The Department of Energy has shown that we can drastically reduce our Nation's climate change pollution without increasing the number of nuclear plants. We can and should solve the problem of climate change without increasing the problems of nuclear waste and safety. 
   I wish that I could support the McCain-Lieberman amendment, as I did 2 years ago. But by making the nuclear industry eligible for yet more subsidies, as a matter of principle, I cannot vote for this year's version.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the reconciliation bill before the Senate. 
   The bill would cut vital programs for the middle class, elderly, and poor in order to pave the way for yet another tax cut for the richest individuals in the county. 
   Hurricane Katrina focused the Nation's attention on America's poor and displaced. In the wake of the storm, the people demanded that Congress act to help Americans in need and were justifiably angry at the administration's slow and inadequate response. Americans recognize that their government should aid those in distress in order to make this a better country for everyone. 
   That is why I cannot believe only 2 months after Katrina, we have a bill that would cut Medicare and Medicaid by $27 billion, increase Medicare premiums for seniors, cut the availability of affordable housing, and cut support for our farmers by $3 billion. 
   Even worse, the House of Representatives is looking to make even deeper cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and to cut the food stamp program, child support enforcement, the foster care program, and student loan programs. 
   These cuts will harm millions of Americans. 
   And why are the Republicans doing this? Not to reduce the deficit, which is spinning out of control, but to provide tax cuts for millionaires that will at the end of the day actually increase the deficit. 
   The tax portion of the reconciliation package will provide $70 billion in tax breaks--$30 billion more than the proposed spending cuts. In a perversion of the budget reconciliation process, the Republicans will be adding to, not decreasing, the Nation's $8 trillion debt. 
   The majority of those $70 billion in tax breaks will go to the wealthy. People making over $1 million a year will get an average tax cut of $35,491. In comparison, those making between $50,000 to $200,000 a year will get a break of $122. And those making less than $50,000 a year will get an average tax cut of $6. 
   That means that people who are most hurt by the spending cuts--the middle class, seniors, and the poor--will get almost no benefit the tax cuts. 
   The reconciliation package also is a windfall for big oil. It would allow them to drill in one of American's most pristine areas--Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Fragile wilderness will be opened, threatened, and ultimately ruined for the sake of 6 months' worth of oil. 
   What makes America the greatest Nation in the world is our sense of community and compassion. Americans look out for each other, and our government should do the same. 
   The budget reconciliation package reflects none of the core American values of compassion and equity. Instead,  it harms those who are most vulnerable in order to benefit the rich and a handful of special interests. 
   For these reasons, I cannot support the budget reconciliation spending bill and will vote against it.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cantwell for her wonderful leadership on this issue. 
   I sit here and I am listening to this debate which we have been involved in so many times. Now I know why Christie Todd Whitman wrote her book ``It Is My Party, Too.'' 
   When you look at who set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, it was a Republican President. Here the biggest forces for opening drilling are coming from the Republican Party, fervor about how this is going to solve our energy problems when everyone admits if we get oil out of their at all it is not going to be for another 10 years, and the economically recoverable oil is 6 months, maybe. So the zealotry that we hear shows the changes in the Republican Party. That is a fact of life. 
   Now, let's see what President Eisenhower's Secretary of Interior, Fred Seaton, said about this area. He said this was ``one of the most magnificent wildlife areas in North America ..... a wilderness experience not duplicated elsewhere.'' Senator GEORGE ALLEN called it the dark side of the Moon. So who is right--President Eisenhower or Senator Allen? Let's take a look at some of the photographs because we need to see this dark side of the Moon. 
   The first thing we see is the porcupine caribou herd, the mother and the little calf. Quite beautiful. It does not look much like the dark side of the Moon to me. The U.S. Geological Survey Biological Resource Division found the porcupine caribou herd may be particularly sensitive to oil development. 
   Let's look at the effects on the caribou and other animals, including bears. This is my favorite, a polar bear photograph taken by a wonderful photographer who spent 18 months in the wildlife refuge. It does not look much like the dark side of the Moon to me. And polar bears are particularly sensitive to oil development because they den in the winter--exactly the time the oil companies want to drill. 
   Millions of migratory birds--over 130 species--journey to our States, so our States will be impacted. To me, this is a God-given environment. With all the talk about faith-based politics, if you do believe, as I do, that these are gifts, then we have to be careful in what we are doing here today.  
   My friend from Alaska says we are going to do this very sensitively. They were very sensitive at the Exxon Valdez. They were very sensitive in Santa Barbara when we had the unbelievable oil spill that led to, actually, the very first Earth Day because it was so devastating to see what happens. We know that the economic activity that comes from oil drilling is going to have an impact. So anyone who tells you anything else simply is thinking in a wishful fashion. We are alive today, we see what happens with the spills. Let's be careful what we are doing. If this is something that will make us energy independent, that is one thing. But the fact is, it won't. 
   Let's look at some of the scenes because there was talk about how barren this area is. We will look at some of the landscapes because it is important to look at this and decide for ourselves if it is worth risking this for 6 months' worth of oil. 
   This is along Marsh Creek in the coastal plain, in the very area they say is completely barren. One of my colleagues said it only looks that way for a few weeks. Well, it certainly looks that way at a point in time. When I sent my environmental legislative assistant up to that area, she was overcome. I went to Alaska. It is true there are other magnificent areas of Alaska, but this is one of those beautiful areas. 
   Here is the issue. The oil companies are backing out. They do not want to be involved in this controversial area. Many have already backed out. BP, ConocoPhillips, and ChevronTexaco have pulled out because they know what they are walking into here, and they don't want to drill. It may be that even if we get the vote, no one will drill there. We are not sure of that. Why is this happening? I 
   say it is happening because if they could open this area, they can open any area. Don't take my word for it; you can take the Bush administration's word for it. That is what they have said in essence. They admit it.

   Mrs. BOXER. Here is the point. This area was set aside by a Republican President who found it to be most pristine. We understand there are certain times in this Senate when we do something as radical as this, which is to open up a wildlife refuge, we may want to have a few more votes. That is kind of the rules of the Senate. They are doing a backdoor, so they may get 51 votes here, and with 51 votes they open this--for what, maybe 6 months' worth of oil. If we close the SUV loopholes, if we said over time they should get the same mileage as cars, we would have seven ANWR fields over 40 or 50 years. 
   We do not need to do this. If you believe this is God-given land, let's protect it. At the end of the day, that is our job. I hope we get the votes. If we do not get them today, this will be a big issue out in the country. I hope the oil companies will continue to walk away from this because clearly it is very controversial to go into this pristine area. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, at the end of 2002, the Maritime Transportation Security Act became law. 
   I was a member of the conference committee on that bill, and I think it was a good first step in improving security at our Nation's ports. 
   It had many good provisions, such as the creation of national and regional maritime transportation/port security plans to be approved by the Coast Guard; better coordination of Federal State, local, and private enforcement agencies; and the establishment of a grant program for port authorities, waterfront facilities operators, and State and local agencies to provide security infrastructure improvements. 
   The problem with the bill was that it had no guaranteed funding mechanism. As a result, we are underfunding port security. Since the passage of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, the Department of Homeland Security has awarded approximately $625 million in port security grants. This is not enough. The Coast Guard has estimated a need for $5.4 billion over 10 years for port facility upgrades, and $7.3 billion over 10 years for all port security. At the same time, the administration only requested $600 million for infrastructure protection in fiscal year 2006, and this meager figure does not even specify a dedicated portion for port security grants.  
   With over 40 percent of the Nation's goods imported through California's ports, a terrorist attack at a California port would not only be tragic but would be devastating for our Nation's economy. 
   So, today, I am reintroducing a bill to provide more funding to the ports. Specifically, it will create a Port Security Grant Program in the Department of Homeland Security; provide $800 million per year for 5 years in grant funding; and--this is very important to California's ports--allow the Federal Government to help finance larger multi-year projects similar to what is done with many of our airports for aviation security. 
   I hope that the Senate will act on this bill. Now is not the time to slow down or delay our efforts to increase and improve transportation security. The job is not done, and it must be done.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, once again, the Senate will vote on whether to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. If it passes now, this may be the last time we vote on the issue. This may be the last chance we have to save one of America's most pristine areas. So, I want to talk about what our Nation will lose if we allow drilling to go forward. 
   In 1960, when President Eisenhower set aside 8.9 million acres to form the original Arctic Range, his Secretary of the Interior, Fred Seaton, noted that the area was ``one of the most magnificent wildlife and wilderness areas in North America ..... a wilderness experience not duplicated elsewhere.'' 
   And the Coastal Plain, where oil drilling is proposed, is the area's ``biological heart''--a crucial habitat for hundreds of species of animals. 
   The Porcupine Caribou herd migrates through the Coastal Plain each year, and--with a population of 130,000--it is the world's largest caribou herd. Its 800-mile-long migration between Canada and the United States is second only to the wildebeests of Africa. The Coastal Plain is the principal calving ground for the porcupine caribou, so they are especially vulnerable to oil drilling. 
   The Arctic Refuge has the highest concentration of land polar bears on Alaska's North Slope. Polar bears are particularly sensitive to oil development because they den in winter--exactly the time oil companies want to drill. 
   Millions of migratory birds--over 130 species--journey thousands of miles each spring to nest and feed in the wetlands on the Coastal Plain. The birds travel from six continents and every State in America. 
   Oil drilling--with its associated roads, pipelines, processing plants, airstrips, and other industrial facilities--would disturb these species' nesting and foraging habitats. The birds in the backyards and skies in every one of our States could become fewer and fewer in number if we disturb the area they have depended upon for millions of years. 
   Finally, I want to mention the muskox, which live year-round in the refuge. Oil development would displace them from their preferred feeding areas and would reduce calving rates. 
   Mr. President, this is one of America's--indeed, one of the world's--wilderness treasures. It is unique, pristine, and unspoiled. 
   Why would we risk that? We don't even get that much oil--6 months worth of oil--and not until 10 years from now. 
   But don't take my word for it--just look at the reaction from America's oil companies. BP, Conoco-Philipps, and Chevron-Texaco have all pulled out of Arctic Power, the lobby group trying to open up the Refuge to drilling. 
   If the very companies that would put up the capital and resources do not care about drilling in the Refuge, how can anyone argue that we will be able to improve our oil supply? 
   If we were really concerned about energy security, we would require better replacement tires on cars, close the SUV loophole on fuel economy standards, and increase those standards overall. 
   Closing the SUV loophole alone would save us, in 7 years, the same amount of oil we would get from the Refuge. That is saving an Arctic National Wildlife Refuge every 7 years. Let me put it another way. In 20 years, we would save the equivalent amount of oil that we would get from three ANWRs. 
   Given that there is only about 6 months of oil in the Arctic Refuge and that the oil companies do not want to go there, what is this really all about? 
   I believe it is really about establishing a precedent for opening up other areas around the country to oil drilling. 
   That means off the coast of California, the Carolinas, and Florida. That means in our national parks, the Rocky Mountains, and our wetlands. 
   Ever since the Senate voted to pave the way for oil drilling in the Refuge  back in March, this is exactly what we have seen--repeated attempts to allow drilling in areas previously off limits. If we can open an area as pristine, as unique, and as precious as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, what couldn't be opened up? 
   And so I say to my colleagues, watch out: your backyard may be next. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Cantwell amendment, which will protect the Refuge for our children and grandchildren.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, yesterday in Burbank, CA, I gave a major address before my constituents announcing my opposition to the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court of the United States. 
   Today I am announcing my opposition to the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court of the United States. 
   According to article II of the Constitution, Justices of the Supreme Court may not be appointed by the President without the advice and consent of the Senate. So it is our solemn duty to consider each nomination carefully, keeping in mind the interests of the American people. 
   This nomination is particularly crucial because the stakes have rarely been so high. 
   First, consider the context in which this nomination comes before us. The seat that Judge Alito has been nominated for is now held by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who came to the Court in 1981. 
   For years, Justice O'Connor has provided the tie-breaking vote and a commonsense voice of reason in some of the most important cases to come before the Court, including a woman's right to choose, civil rights, and freedom of religion. 
   Second, consider the tumultuous political climate in our Nation. President Bush understood that in 2000 when he promised to govern from the center, and be ``a uniter, not a divider.'' Sadly, this nomination shows that he has forgotten that promise because it is not from the center and it is not uniting the Nation. 
   The right thing to do would have been to give us a justice in the mold of Justice O'Connor, and that is what the President should have done. 
   Let me be clear: I do not deny Judge Alito's judicial qualifications. He has been a government lawyer and judge for more than 20 years and the American Bar Association rated him well qualified. He is an intelligent and capable person. His family should be proud of him and all Americans should be proud that the American dream was there for the Alito family. 
   But after reviewing the hearing record and the record of his statements, writings and rulings over the past 24 years, I am convinced that Judge Alito is the wrong person for this job. 
   I am deeply concerned about how Justice Alito will impact the ability of other families to live the American dream to be assured of privacy in their homes and their personal lives, to be secure in their neighborhoods, to have fair treatment in the workplace, and to have confidence that the power of the executive branch will be checked. 
   As I reviewed Judge Alito's record, I asked whether he will vote to preserve fundamental American liberties and values. 
   Will Justice Alito vote to uphold Congress's constitutional power to pass laws to protect Americans' health, safety, and welfare? Judge Alito's record says no. 
   In the 1996 Rybar case, Judge Alito voted to strike down the Federal ban on the transfer or possession of machine guns because he believed it exceeded Congress's power under the Commerce Clause. His Third Circuit colleagues sharply criticized his dissent and said that it ran counter to ``a basic tenet of the constitutional separation of powers.'' And Judge Alito's extremist view has been rejected by six other circuit courts and the Supreme Court. Judge Alito stood alone and failed to protect our families. 
   In a case concerning worker protection, Judge Alito was again in the minority when he said that Federal mine health and safety standards did not apply to a coal processing site. He tried to explain it as just a ``technical issue of interpretation.'' I fear for the safety of our workers if Judge Alito's narrow, technical reading of the law should ever prevail. 
   Will Justice Alito vote to protect the right to privacy, especially a woman's reproductive freedom? Judge Alito's record says no. 
   We have all heard about Judge Alito's 1985 job application, in which he wrote that the Constitution does not protect the right of a woman to choose. He was given the chance to disavow that position during the hearings and he refused to do so. He had the chance to say, as Judge Roberts did, that Roe v. Wade is settled law, and he refused. 
   He had the chance to explain his dissent in the Casey decision, in which he argued that the Pennsylvania spousal notification requirement was not an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion because it would affect only a small number of women, but he refused to back away from his position. The Supreme Court, by a 5 to 4 vote, found the provision to be unconstitutional, and Justice O'Connor, co-writing for the Court, criticized the faulty analysis supported by Judge Alito, saying that ``the analysis does not end with the one percent of women'' affected ..... ``it begins there.'' 
   To my mind, Judge Alito's ominous statements and narrow-minded reasoning clearly signal a hostility to women's rights, and portend a move back toward the dark days when abortion was illegal in many states, and many women died as a result. In the 21st century, it is astounding that a Supreme Court nominee would not view Roe v. Wade as settled law when its fundamental principle a woman's right to choose--has been reaffirmed many times since it was decided. 
   Will Justice Alito vote to protect Americans from unconstitutional searches? Judge Alito's record says no. 
   In Doe v. Groody in 2004, he said a police strip search of a 10-year-old girl was lawful, even though their search warrant didn't name her. Judge Alito said that even if the warrant did not actually authorize the search of the  girl, ``a reasonable police officer could certainly have read the warrant as doing so . . .'' This casual attitude toward one of our most basic constitutional guarantees--the fourth amendment right against unreasonable searches--is almost shocking. As Judge Alito's own Third Circuit Court said regarding warrants, ``a particular description is the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment.'' We certainly do not need Supreme Court Justices who do not understand this fundamental constitutional protection. 
   Will Justice Alito vote to let citizens stop companies from polluting their communities? Judge Alito's record says no. 
   In the Magnesium Elektron case, Judge Alito voted to make it harder for citizens to sue for toxic emissions that violate the Clean Water Act. Fortunately, in another case several years later, the Supreme Court rejected the Third Circuit and Alito's narrow reading of the law. Judge Alito doesn't seem to care about a landmark environmental law. 
   Will Justice Alito vote to let working women and men have their day in court against employers who discriminate against them? Judge Alito's record says no. 
   In 1997, in the Bray case, Judge Alito was the only judge on the Third Circuit to say that a hotel employee claiming racial discrimination could not take her case to a jury. 
   In the Sheridan case, a female employee sued for discrimination, alleging that after she complained about incidents of sexual harassment, she was demoted and marginalized to the point that she was forced to quit. By a vote of 10 to 1, the Third Circuit found for the plaintiff. 
   Guess who was the one? Only Judge Alito thought the employee should have to show that discrimination was the ``determinative cause'' of the employer's action. Using his standard would make it almost impossible for a woman claiming discrimination in the workplace to get to trial. 
   Finally, will Justice Alito be independent from the executive branch that appointed him, and be a vote against power grabs by the president? Judge Alito's record says no. 
   As a lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department, he authored a memo suggesting a new way for the President to encroach on Congress's lawmaking powers. He said that when the President signs a law, he should make a statement about the law, giving it his own interpretation, whether it was consistent with what Congress had written or not. He wrote that this would ``get in the last word on questions of interpretation'' of the law. In the hearings, Judge Alito refused to back away from this memo. 
   When asked whether he believed the President could invade another country, in the absence of an imminent threat, without first getting the approval of the American people, of Congress, Judge Alito refused to rule it out. 
   When asked if the President had the power to authorize someone to engage in torture, Alito refused to answer. 
   The administration is now asserting vast powers, including spying on American citizens without seeking warrants--in clear violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--violating international treaties, and ignoring laws that ban torture. We need Justices who will put a check on such overreaching by the executive, not rubberstamp it. Judge Alito's record and his answers at the hearings raise very serious doubts about his commitment to being a strong check on an `imperial President.' 
   In addition to these substantive matters, I remain concerned about Judge Alito's answers regarding his membership in the Concerned Alumni of Princeton and his failure to recuse himself from the Vanguard case, which he had promised to do. 
   During the hearings, we all felt great compassion for Mrs. Alito when she became emotional in reaction to the tough questions her husband faced in the Judiciary Committee. Everyone in politics knows how hard it is for families when a loved one is asked tough questions. It is part of a difficult process, and whoever said politics is not for the faint of heart was right. 
   Emotions have run high during this process. That is understandable. But I wish the press had focused more on the tears of those who will be affected if Judge Alito becomes Justice Alito and his out-of-the-mainstream views prevail. 
   I worry about the tears of a worker who, having failed to get a promotion because of discrimination, is denied the opportunity to pursue her claim in court. 
   I worry about the tears of a mentally ill woman who is forced by law to tell her husband that she wants to terminate her pregnancy and is afraid that he will leave her or stop supporting her. 
   I worry about the tears of a young girl who is strip searched in her own home by police who have no valid warrant. 
   I worry about the tears of a mentally retarded man, who has been brutally assaulted in his workplace, when his claim of workplace harassment is dismissed by the court simply because his lawyer failed to file a well-written brief on his behalf. 
   These are real cases in which Judge Alito has spoken. Fortunately, he did not prevail in these cases. But if he goes to the Supreme Court, he will have a much more powerful voice--a radical voice that will replace a voice of moderation and balance. 
   Perhaps the most important statement Judge Alito made during the entire hearing process was when he told the Judiciary Committee that he expects to be the same kind of Justice on the Supreme Court as he has been a judge on the Circuit Court. 
   That is precisely the problem. As a judge, Samuel Alito seemed to approach his cases with an analytical coldness that reflected no concern for the human consequences of his reasoning. 
   Listen to what he said about a case involving an African-American man convicted of murder by an all-White jury in a courtroom where the prosecutors had eliminated all African-American jurors in many previous murder trials as well. 
   Judge Alito dismissed this evidence of racial bias and said that the jury makeup was no more relevant than the fact that left-handers have won five of the last six Presidential elections. When asked about this analogy during the hearings, he said it ``went to the issue of statistics . . . (which) is a branch of mathematics, and there are ways to analyze statistics so that you draw sound conclusions from them. .....'' 
   That response would have been appropriate for a college math professor, but it is deeply troubling from a potential Supreme Court Justice. 
   As the great jurist and Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. wrote in 1881, ``The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience . . . The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.'' 
   What Holmes meant is that the law is a living thing, that those who interpret it must do so with wisdom and humanity, and with an understanding of the consequences of their judgments for the lives of the people they affect. 
   It is with deep regret that I conclude that Judge Alito's judicial philosophy lacks this wisdom, humanity and moderation. He is simply too far out of the mainstream in his thinking. His opinions demonstrate neither the independence of mind nor the depth of heart that I believe we need in our Supreme Court Justices, particularly at this crucial time in our Nation's history. 
   That is why I will oppose this nomination.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to name the courthouse in Sacramento, California, as the ``Robert T. Matsui United States Courthouse.'' I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators FEINSTEIN and DURBIN.  
   Congressman Matsui's death on January 1, 2005 was shocking to all of us. Naming the Federal Courthouse in Sacramento in his honor would be a very appropriate memorial to his continual efforts toward a just and fair society. 
   After his childhood internment, Bob Matsui could have chosen to dwell on the sadness of his early years. Instead, he chose to give his life to public service, working to improve the lives of those in his congressional district and all Americans. He was a true patriot. 
   He was first elected to Congress in 1978, and spent the past 26 years representing the citizens of Sacramento with distinction and pride. He served as a senior member of the Committee on Ways and Means, and took a particular interest in complex public policy issues including tax, international trade, social security, healthcare, and welfare reform. 
   Congressman Matsui's dedication to the well-being of America's children earned him the Congressional Advocate of the Year award from The Child Welfare League of America in 1992 and 1994. The Congressman was also honored with the Anti Defamation League's Lifetime Achievement Award for his commitment to human rights. 
   Included in Congressman Matsui's long list of legislative achievements were his accomplishments to benefit the people of his district including flood control, transportation, and his success in obtaining $142 million in federal funding for the courthouse in Sacramento. 
   A graduate of the University of California at Berkeley and Hastings College of Law, he founded his own law practice in 1967, and was elected to the Sacramento City Council in 1971. After winning reelection in 1975 he became vice mayor of Sacramento in 1977. Congressman Matsui is survived by his wife, Doris Matsui, their son Brian and his wife Amy, and granddaughter, Anna.

   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that will protect hundreds of thousands of acres of wilderness in Northern California. The Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act would designate over 300,000 acres in 14 areas as wilderness and would protect 21 miles of the Black Butte Creek as wild and scenic. The Senate passed this legislation during the 108th Congress, and I am hopeful this year that the bill will become law. 
   California's natural treasures have always been one of the things that make California unique, drawing millions of people to them over the years to revel in their wild beauty. But that beauty must not be taken for granted. It is important that we move now to designate these special places in California as wilderness to protect them for the enjoyment of future generations. 
   That is why I introduced the statewide California Wild Heritage Act during the 107th Congress and the 108th Congress, and I will soon be reintroducing it. The California Wild Heritage Act would protect more than 2.5 million acres of public land throughout the state of California, as well as the free-flowing portions of 23 rivers. Every acre of wild land is a treasure, but the areas protected in this bill are some of California's most precious. 
   I am pleased to join Representative Mike Thompson of California in introducing this legislation, which protect those portions of my statewide bill that are located in California's First Congressional District. The areas protected under this legislation are some of the most magnificent wild places in our state. For example, in southwestern Humboldt and northwestern Mendocino counties, over 42,000 acres of the King Range will be protected as wilderness. This is the wildest portion of the California coast, boasting the longest stretch of undeveloped coastline in the United States outside of Alaska. 
   This bill will protect watersheds that provide clean water to our cities and farms. This bill would also protect the precious plant and animal species that make their homes in these areas. Endangered and threatened species whose habitats will be protected by this bill include the bald eagle, California brown pelican, steelhead trout, coho salmon, bald eagle, peregrine falcon, northern spotted owl, and Roosevelt elk. 
   During the last 20 years, 675,000 acres of unprotected wilderness lost their wilderness character due to activities such as logging and mining. As our population increases, and California becomes home to almost 50 million people by the middle of the century, development pressures threaten our remaining wild places. We must protect our precious wild lands and wild rivers before they are lost forever. 
   Mr. President, those of us who live in the United States have a very special responsibility to protect our natural heritage. With this legislation, we are one step closer to protecting this legacy for our children's children, and their children.
